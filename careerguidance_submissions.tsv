vh275k	1655777526	166	Hello all, thank you for reading. I am a 30 year old that received his PhD in computational physics in 2018, got my dream job as a research scientist at MIT, and am now miserable. My job shifted from an academic position to one where I perform systems level research. I cannot publish but I present my analysis as a PowerPoint to key stakeholders. I have a good mix of technical work and presentations. In theory I should be happy but I often come home from work angry. I don't receive much guidance in my role and I don't get along with my coworkers. I don't know if this is burnout, not enjoying the work, or adjusting to work after grad school. What should my next steps be? I am out of the academic pipeline so a post doc is out. Should I try another group at my lab? Should I try to be an ML engineer? I'm a bit lost as to what my options are.
vgdn2v	1655701947	162	 Hello,I have worked in proposals for most of my career. I have a Master's in Professional Writing, and I started out in 2008 as a proposal editor/writer, and I'm currently a Sr. Proposal Manager.After 14 years, I have lost my passion for proposals. I'm still performing my duties, but I've lost my enthusiasm for it, I don't know what it is - maybe it's burnout, or maybe I've just reached the limit of my patience with the never-ending melodrama of US Federal Government contracting, but I would like to see if something else reignites my passion.Are there any fields out there that could use someone with proposal management skills?Ideally, I'm looking to transition to a career where my current skills would best apply. If that's not possible, I'm willing to pick up a new skill or two via training/certification to improve my ability to successfully transition. I'm not the most technical person, but I'm always willing to learn.Thank you for your help!
vfe0rr	1655582366	115	I (22F) am in a pretty well known fellowship program that’s supposed to help me find a full time corporate position after it’s over, but I’m suffering from severe burnout. I went to a vigorous high school and college, graduated early, then went straight into the workforce, but honestly I’m so tired that it’s affecting my mental health and causing me to dread going to work. I’ve been considering taking some time off after the program instead of moving straight into another position, but I feel like the gap would hurt my chances of finding a job when I would start working again. Is taking a break worth it or should I just keep pushing through?
veudmj	1655512748	138	I’m bound to an X year commitment at the organization or I would have to pay back what the organization paid for me to earn my masters degree. I have about 6 months until I can voluntarily resign. However I’m feeling burnt out and stuck at a crossroads. I also don’t want to leave so abruptly to where they feel I used the them for school. I genuinely love the mission of the organization, I’m just overworked and getting to the point where I invest so much of my time and energy and it’s becoming a detriment to my health and relationships outside of work. I don’t think I could financially pay them back for my school so I’m stuck, any advice on how to get out of the burnout slump or timing if I were to move on?
ve1e2x	1655429697	106	Burnout after 4 months at big 4I’m new to big 4 consulting and trying to get used to the lifestyle and expectations. I think I’ve been putting a lot of pressure on myself and have not been able to disconnect. I think about my project all the time outside of work and on the weekends. I try really hard to not think about it, but the thoughts always creep in. I’ve lost interest in the work and subject matter. A part of me just wants to leave and find something else, but the other part wants me to power through it. Any have experience with this? Thanks!

vc256k	1655208876	291	Hey all,Been feeling a bit lost lately. I’m 23 and graduated in 2020 with a Bachelors in Finance, but just barely passed my degree and didn’t have any internships. Couldn’t find any entry level jobs with my degree and I was getting rejected by firms left right and centre. I’m now working full-time as an entry level lab technician in the mean time, but just making very slightly above minimum wage. The work is very physically demanding, and I want to be in a role where it’s more technical and problem-solving focused compared to a routine physical job. I guess I just want something that’s mentally stimulating. I’m expecting a  $2-3/hr increase in the next few months as part of becoming an intermediate lab tech, and we have more career pathways to go from there (like Quality Assurance,  Team Leader etc) however from my coworkers’ experience a lot of their careers stagnate at the intermediate level with high levels of burnout and relatively low pay, despite putting in more work. Progression isn’t always guaranteed. I’m not really quite sure if I’m prepared to stay here for a couple more years for a chance I *may* get something better as I’m physically burnt out as it is. Relocation is not an option either as I’ve got family to support and my partner has a very stable teaching job in town he can’t just leave. Money is mostly the concern really, as my current job’s extremely underpaid for the amount of work expected and I’d like to be able to support my partner as well when we get a place together. Any tips and advice how to figure this one out, where could I go, would be highly appreciated :) Thank you!
vbs5a2	1655171027	204	A few days ago my boss (55F) was so upset I had mentioned to dept head (M50) she was overwhelmed and she had a ton of people pass away recently (which she told everyone about) etc and saying to like do something to help her. yesterday when I talked to her she had said she doesn’t care if they replace her or put someone above her at this point which was weird. today she started like having panic attacks first thing when she got in and not doing well so I told her she should go home I’ll handle things and reach out if I need to. And then I talked to the dept head again and told him there’s too much work and I’ve never seen my boss this overwhelmed before and she’s under appreciated and then the owner had asked and I told him the same thing. It’s definitely hitting me that this was NOT my place. I feel really bad, none of this was trying to make her look bad or anything. She did the same thing for me when I had a huge mental health crisis a few months ago. How should I move forward from here to make things right?
vbp6v9	1655161810	128	Hi everyone,I am currently working as a registered nurse (RN) in Ontario for almost a year now. Although I do not mind my job, I am feeling the effects of the pandemic and healthcare-related burnout more and more these days. I'm interested in possibly a career change to Scrum Master or Project Management, but unsure of which one to pursue. I'm not looking to make an immediate career change, but wanted to start to looking at options before I felt completely burned out. I looked into the Scrum Master certification via Scrum Alliance and the courses seem somewhat affordable. I know it will be a bit trickier to break out into these career options with little to no experience, but any advice offered would be greatly appreciated.Thanks in advance!
vbmwnx	1655155561	292	So I'm (27M) currently in my 6 month as a business development manager for a IT software company. The pay is better then anything i ever have had and I get to remote so there no complaints in that regard. I came to my current company when my boss from my last BDR gig left and became a head executive over here, he had his choice out of 30 plus BDR's and choose me to come with him and earn more money with a better title.    However, during these 6 months of I have found the sales team I need to work with on the daily is just lazy as hell, and have no idea what they are doing. The head of sales at this company is a complete asshole and makes endless excuses for his lazy team and there lack luster performance. They find reasons to turn away every client or booking, because its to much work. There has also been a mass exodus of talent unlike anything I have ever witness at any job. I'm a true cross-roads because my boss is an amazing guy and has always been an amazing mentor &amp; friend over two years of working together, however I'm finding myself more burnout then ever and cant seem to put up with the good ol' boys club to much longer here. Also since its a sales job commission is a big part and this sales team is making sure i get absolutely no credit on deals getting passed forward.Do I stay and collect the great base pay/being the lowest on the totem pole but have a mentor in my corner or do i start to look elsewhere for a better environment &amp; bet on myself?
vajnnx	1655031855	949	 I know your screen time is precious, so I'll do my best to make this post entertaining. If you don't want the full story, I'll put a \*\*\* mark below - you can start reading from there.So here I am, just turned 32, and I desperately need a change. Pretty much any change will do, to be honest.I'm a lawyer based in the colder part of the EU. Why did I become a lawyer? I don't know. I shit you not. I was never bad at maths and sciences, but I wasn't good either. I read A LOT as a kid/teenager and loved literature. I was pretty sensitive too, and still am. I wanted to be a writer. I tried to write, but each time I tried, I got paralyzed by fear of it being worthless and useless. Most of the time, I couldn't enjoy it at all. Now the thought of sitting down and writing anything creative seems so daunting and scary and boring and tiring and I don't even know why. It's exhausting, so I don't even try.But I'm digressing. So the fact that I read so much and wasn't the best in technical subjects led me to study liberal arts. My uni curriculum was a bit of everything, with a focus on philosophy. I also did law school which I hated with a passion. It was the antithesis of what I ever wanted to be. The matter was dull, perfectly non-creative, and the professors mostly didn't give a shit about teaching actual skills. It was just something you needed to get through to get your diploma. It was neither challenging nor interesting. The kids I studied with mostly just wanted to live the glamourous lawyerly life and get rich (boy oh boy were they in for a surprise).I guess it was during that time I developed a very nice and crippling case of anxiety/depression. It took me some time to seek help, so up until recently, I had better and - mostly - bad times with my inner demons. (This is NOT a sob story, I only write about this because It's a factor I have to weigh in).After getting my diploma I decided I never wanted to have anything to do with law and lawyers again. So I took odd jobs as a translator and some voice acting. I realized it's pretty easy to find jobs online. But it wasn't sustainable and well, probably not the best for my CV. So I went on a job hunt, and I landed a job as an in-house lawyer drafting and revising IP contracts for a state agency. I liked it. I liked negotiating. I enjoyed using precise language, and I felt useful translating people's needs into words and vice versa. I did some thinking, and, being an anxious, sensitive, and skinny type, I decided that criminal defense is the right thing to do.Yeah. I wanted to help people. So I did the bar training, got a job in a decent law firm, and began my three-year adventure. I got to know all kinds of thugs and heathens - from white collars to the mentally ill to actual psychopaths to terrorists to spies to innocent activists. I learned a lot, and I was good at it, but the work environment was happily toxic. I got paid close to nothing and worked long hours. Maintaining a social life was extremely difficult; I had to travel a lot and work at night - not only at the office but that's classified.It wasn't good for my mental and physical health. I got burnt out. I couldn't go on like this, so I quit. I work in human rights now. Not much money in it, but at least there's no overtime, my team is relaxed and easy-going, and it's way less stressful (though the stories I deal with are still pretty depressing). I've been working here for over a year, and I don't think I've fully recovered yet.\*\*\*So I'm 32, I have anxiety (though well treated) and burnout, I have "a career" which I hate, and I don't want to be a lawyer. I want to be able to work remotely and spend the upcoming winter somewhere warm. (I thought that seasonal affective disorder was just an excuse, but this year I feel very strongly that I'm a completely different person during the short and dark winter days, and I don't want to be that person anymore). I don't need to be rich, but I want to make enough to feel financially secure and to be able to travel. WHAT DO I DO?My ideas so far were:1. learning programming (duh). I started a python course on udemy, but I got overwhelmed and discouraged plus I know that python knowledge itself won't land me a job.2. Starting a podcast (laugh all you want). I do have a nice voice and I guess I could make it entertaining, but... 1. English is not my native language, 2. can you actually make decent money on it?3. just leaving it all behind and going on the road to find out (don't ask me for details, I don't have any);4. Joining a zen temple - I've been sitting in zazen since I was maybe 13, and, to be honest, spiritual development is the one thing I know I care about.5. Turning my doodles into something profitable - but I can't draw really, it's just that some people find my doodles witty.I know this post is partly just a rant, so if you've read through it, I am very thankful, you're a good person. Any tips and ideas are welcome. What do I do? Where do I go?

va0gfd	1654963004	263	Currently working a Job A for 9 months for 63k, just got a offer at Job B to make 85k but weighing the pros and cons and uncertaintyJob A is a full-time salary w/ benefits but Job B is with a consulting company that contracts out to the company I will work with, so technically would be a contractor but it is also a salary position and will get full benefits, 401k, PTO, etc thru consulting co. (a little more out of pocket than Job A).Job A has been stressful with my dept being understaffed, little company standards. Some weeks are 40 hours with bursts of 60-80 hr weeks before deadlines. Job B seems to be intense as well with quick turn around but involves more routine, copy/paste work mixed with project/ client management. Job A pays overtime, but I'd have to work a lot more overtime than I do now to match Job B's offer.My industry is very sensitive to recessions so the risk I have is taking Job B and being a contractor, get the axe quickly if a downturn happens or if I'm not a good fit. Job A is more stable as their clients (government) are more resilient to downturns but the stress of the job is getting to me and feeling the burnout and there's always a chance I'd be let go anyway if things go south.I would not have entertained Job B's offer if it was closer in salary to Job A but the income increase is substantial, I'm just torn trading stability for something more risky. Thanks.
v9txr3	1654939584	577	How do I choose the best career option for my interests, personality, and strengths? I am thinking about HVAC or electrician, but what if I don’t want to be an electrician or HVAC guy forever? I don’t think the trades are as versatile as certain degrees.I’m trying to get out of poverty too. I have a warehouse job that I don’t like. I feel like my options are Trades: Decent pay, although apparently hard on the body as you age. I mean I’m fit but idk. I hear people say that the best way to make money in the trades is to start your own business, but I don’t think I’m that much of a business guy.  I guess I’m just don’t want to feel stuck. Trade work does interest me though, I like physical work, and trades allow me to use my brain with that. I’m smart too.College: this would mean I’d have to stay at my current job (I’m looking for a better one anyways though, but still...) and it takes longer. This is a matter of patience. The warning potential could be higher too, but I’m not guaranteed a job right out of college. It’s a lot to take into consideration.Military: this would be my final resort. I don’t think I’d enjoy it, what I would love though is the physical stuff and discipline. I know you can learn skills that can transfer to civilian life as well. Assuming one doesn’t want to make a career out of it, of course. Knowing me, like I said, I don’t like to feel stuck without any freedom. I’d do a short contract to learn cool valuable skills and move on. I’d have military background/experience which could be good. Depending on what I learn in the military, would I be better off going the trade route instead? I mean, no one joins the military to become a plumber or electrician right? But still you could come out of the military and do those things. As you can see I’m kind of lost in life right now. I’ve taken endless personality and career tests to see what would be good for me...I’m 22 and working on getting my GED by the way, and I am getting a certificate in supply chain management but I don’t think I’d enjoy that field.I like both using my mind and body on a job. I’d like for it to have some meaning to me. I want money too, but it’s really not as important as meaning/happiness to me. As long as it’s decent stable income.I really like science and have been good at physics in particular. Computer science is interesting, but I really don’t think I’d enjoy sitting at a computer for long periods.I have passions/hobbies but they aren’t that lucrative. -Dancing-ArtI hear people say not to work in your passion field because it can lead to burnout. Then I hear “work your passion and you’ll never really work, because you just like doing it”I am always thinking. I like being physical building things and fixing things. I really enjoy helping people, but in an indirect way, if that makes sense. Like if I could perhaps be a firefighter that’s be awesome.I am also into art. I appreciate it and I like to create paintings and drawings.That’s about it! I am sorry if my post comes off as pessimistic. I’m actually quite positive about my future. Just feeling a little down/lost.Thank you!!!
v8g96e	1654779375	354	Hi everyone! I think I may need to switch career fields, and I’m wondering if anyone here would know what the next logical step is?I’m currently working as a salaried employee for a nonprofit, so I’m naturally underpaid for what I do, but I’m at my limit with doing three jobs in one/having to take my work laptop on PTO/working unpaid overtime constantly but not getting to enjoy the flexibility a salaried position usually affords.I’m a marketing manager: I run my organization’s social media accounts and WordPress website. I’m also their graphic design department and create anything from infographics to logos to flyers to illustrated maps. I do video editing, email campaigns, fundraising websites and direct mail pieces. Copywriting — I write pretty much all of the CEO’s correspondence including newsletters and Board communications, donor reports, program flyers, social media captions, video scripts, landing page copy, talking points at events. I’m also their unofficial IT person — coworkers always come to me with tech issues, which I can usually resolve on my own or with a quick Google search.The organization is incredibly happy with my work — the only area where I receive critique is in fund development, where I’m supposed to be proofing donor mailing lists and acknowledgement letters. I don’t know if my heart just isn’t in it, I’m over tired or my brain doesn’t work that way, but I always end up missing simple errors and annoying my boss, who otherwise showers me with praise and says I can never leave them lol.Problem is, for my mental and physical health, I think I do need to leave soon. But I want my next job to have a narrower focus, I guess, and I’m scared of ending up in this position of constantly working long hours with tight deadlines while being under compensated, if I take a role as an e commerce manager or something. Does my random skill set translate to anything that isn’t….this? I feel like my entire life is just my job now, and I’m tired of being expected to work through my lunch and be on call during PTO.
v7vmih	1654710830	178	I care a lot about mental health and helping people. Im a 29m and work in tech currently. I've come close to dropping everything for a clinical mental health masters but I can bring myself to do it. I just am a bit introverted and can seen myself having my own practice, advertising myself, going through the intensity of even getting to that place. I hear of burnout as well. I've thought maybe a school counselor, but not sure if that would be a good fit either. Medical is an interest maybe, but I don't think I could work with gross stuff. So not sure what I want. I really would like to dive into mental health and help people, but I just don't know if I'm cut out for being a therapist. I'm not trying to avoid working with people, but not sure about back to back sessions and having to process everything I here. And then advertising myself in a private practice. Not sure if even with my strong interest I have a place in the field.
v7q7uv	1654696511	320	I'm a pretty well-achieving physics student at a top university, but I've spent so much time studying that I've never really thought about what I want to do once my degree's over. Kinda panicking since I'm coming up to my final year now!!I've come to actually despise most of physics due to burnout, although I can safely say I know a lot about it. Writing scientific research reports comes pretty naturally for me now. I'm great at mathematics and solving logic problems. I can code simulations and basic AI algorithms in Python, but can't really code anything like a utility, website, or iot-based program. I could probably learn though, especially since I did CS at GCSE, AS, and A-level. I love drawing, crochet, and knitting. Almost all of my notes are littered with daft little drawings, and I've filled many sketchbooks. I'd ideally want something that's both logic and creative.I've thought of some 'dream ideas' but don't really think they're viable as careers - especially since I know I'm capable of getting a pretty good job. I started a small crochet pattern business over the summer but can't see it making a decent wage. I thought about writing a maths/physics revision guide but that's kind of a one-off thing and probably won't make me too much either.I also thought about teaching since I enjoy tutoring, but don't really want to deal with the low wages and the abuse from poorly-behaved students. (I could probably take the abuse part since I've dealt with large groups of poorly-behaved kids before, but it's not ideal. I've had enough of hating everything I do every single day for the past two years. Maybe working at a private school is an option? I'm not entirely sure how to get into that though.) Some sort of mathematical office job seems could perhaps be a good idea.Sorry this is really long, but any advice would be much appreciated!
v7dhfr	1654651888	70	Name that job!Hey guys, My partner is looking for a job with certain characteristics, but we're not sure where to even start. He's burnout working in retail and ready tostart towards a fulfilling career. He loves sports, specifically basketball, and is interested in traveling. He would like to do something where he maybe travels. Has more flexibility? Do you all have anycareer recommendations to look into or degrees.Any suggestions are welcome.
v74607	1654627425	167	I have a diploma in veterinary nursing. I worked in practice for several years and suffered severe burnout. I left and worked in animal pharmaceuticals in an admin type role and then immigrated and practiced as an unlicensed tech so back in practice for a couple years, until burnout wiped me out completely (had a severe mental health event).In my previous admin type role, I used to proof read package inserts and translations but the second language I speak is extremely region specific and I do not speak the official second language where I currently reside (Canada). I think I would enjoy English-only (until I learn another language) line editing or proof reading, but I do not have an English degree and most people I speak to in the industry have Masters degrees...Do I stand a chance finding a job in this industry, to even just work in part time while studying an English degree? Any suggestions? Do you know of places offering jobs to people like me?
v662p4	1654529193	945	So, I am a stay at home parent and have been since 2015. I am looking for advice on what path to take to start working toward a new career in the next year or so, but feel absolutely paralyzed by the decision. I have a degree in filmmaking (it actually just says B.S Communications on my diploma), with a focus in art direction/production design and also worked painting scenery for our theater and dance department. That didn't end up being my career because of how toxic the film industry work culture is You know all the stories that have come out about that in the past several years? Yeah, that was all an open secret in the early 00s when I was interning/trying to get started. I decided it wasn't worth it for me.I graduated at the height of the "Great Recession" and ended up working for Starbucks for 2 years, then I worked at a nonprofit solar installer via AmeriCorps for a short while. They were a great cause, but I couldn't make ends meet on a tiny stipend and no health insurance, so I ended up quitting and getting a job in the development side of a well-known animal rights nonprofit. I love animals, but differ with them on some key philosophical points, so it was mostly just a job. I worked there for 2.5 years but was getting more and more depressed because my job was mostly calling donors (which I found stressful) and data entry (mind-numbingly boring). I left because I got a full-ride scholarship to a Master's in Architecture program. So after getting married, we moved to a different city/state and I started grad school. Unfortunately, despite asking multiple questions of multiple people and visiting in person during the application process who assured me it would be reasonable, it turned out that the work-life balance was absolutely non-existent. I worked 90-100 hour weeks, and my physical and mental health and marriage all suffered. After a year, I had to take a semester off to recover from the burnout... And I never went back (I should add that I made excellent grades, so it wasn't that I couldn't hack it academically). After that, I started my own business painting murals, and I was starting to get quite a lot of business, but of course it was a very physical job and very tiring considering I also have a chronic illness. Still, I was managing pretty well until I got pregnant. Unfortunately, it was a very rough pregnancy, and I quickly became too sick to work at all. After that, I decided not to go back to working right away. Well, it's almost 7 years later, and I'm now taking care of baby #3, lol. I don't plan on being at home full time forever, but I'm not sure what I want to do next or even how to get started. I don't know if I want to go back to school, start my own business again, or what. I do feel that, with my resume, it would be very hard to find a good job (meaning one that would pay enough to offset the cost of daycare and be fulfilling enough not to cause burnout or regret not staying home with my kids). I should also probably disclose that I was diagnosed with ADHD last year, which probably has something to do with my extremely, er, eclectic resumé and finding 9-to-5 desk jobs darn near intolerable. I would love to have a more flexible schedule due to that, my kids, and my chronic illness, but I'm realistic that those options may be limited, so I'm open to giving an office environment another try for the right opportunity. Some things that interest me:Permaculture, systems ecology, sustainable agriculture, and environmental causes in general.Animals, biology, nature (I was very good at biology and chemistry in high school and read a lot of life science nonfiction for fun, I also garden, forage, have pets). I wanted to be a vet, zoologist or zookeeper as a kid and used to volunteer at an animal shelter. I would love to work with animals in some way.Art (drawing, painting), illustration, museum exhibits, themed attractions, film/theatrical scenery. Deal breakers:Spending all day on the phone or doing sales (obviously I am realistic that some of this is needed for most jobs, I just don't want it to be the bulk of my time).Constant travel (occasional, say once a quarter or less *on average* is fine).Spending alllll my time outside in extreme heat or cold. (My chronic illness makes me very sensitive to temperature. If I'm out for long periods of time in the heat, I will faint, no matter how much water I drink. This is the main thing keeping me from trying to become a zookeeper, park ranger or field biologist/zoologist which all interest me greatly). I cannot relocate due to my family. Well, if anyone even read all of that, I am extremely grateful for your time. What do you think? Do I try to go back to school for something science-y? Is that even realistic? Would I have to start over with another bachelor's degree? Do I try to start another artsy career, despite the low pay and instability? Maybe freelance illustration or something? Is there any way to *combine* my interests? Is there something else I might do well at that I'm not thinking of? How do I get a *real* sense for what the day-to-day would be like, given I've been pretty bad at determining that in the past? Thanks so much for any and all feedback/advice/ideas you have to offer. Have a great day!
v619d8	1654514709	673	I've been working in this place for about 10 months. Well, that's if you count the last few weeks during which I was out of work due to extreme burnout, anxiety and depression that was triggered in part by situations in work. I should note that I always deal with anxiety and depression, this workplace did not cause it, it only exacerbated it.I think where I work is toxic but I'm generally overly sensitive so I don't know if I should just get over it.Here are some of the things I've experienced, sorry in advance for how long this is.1. Being told to handle one aspect of the business on my own, in which I have little experience and was given no proper training. I was told this would involve responding to ~a few emails a week. But it has resulted in lengthy email threads with clients where I'm taking the brunt of their anger and I don't know how to fix their problem, and have to go back and forth between our freelance web developer and the client. This leads to very convoluted exchanges and as I know absolutely nothing about websites, I find it very confusing. I have also been told to manage website projects and advise clients on the development of their website even though again, I have no experience in this. Our web developer is generally helpful but the process we have for dealing with clients is extremely convoluted - web dev tries to explain web dev stuff to me and then I have to relay this foreign concept to the client who also knows nothing about web development. I should point out the web dev is sometimes very helpful and contacts clients directly, but not all the time. This results in me having to ask questions of the manager and my colleagues quite often. Sometimes they're helpful, other times they've gotten kind of snarky, i.e., rolling their eyes and having the general demeanour of "oh god not this again". 2. A condescending colleague. I confided in him about the above stressful situation and he told me to just "take responsibility and get the job done". He has also "joked" after I remarked that my position is underpaid, that if I don't like working here I can just leave. And after I asked another colleague if he would sit in on a meeting with me with a service provider, the condescending colleague remarked that "just because we use computers, doesn't mean we're IT guys". Of course I'm aware of this, but the colleague in question knows the most about IT out of all of us so I just wanted him to sit in on the meeting with me as he was more likely to understand stuff than me. Again this is all ~banter and maybe I'm just being too sensitive? But this kind of thing is a pattern of behaviour where he seems to think he's better than others and can be quite condescending.3. Inadequate working conditions, in my opinion. Relatively minor stuff - no proper break room, no proper fridge, no urgency in providing us with clean drinkable water (I understand we can just bring our own water but this combined with the other problems makes it a bigger deal to me. It's more the lack of regard for one's employees that bothers me). Water drips from the ceiling onto our desk during heavy rain, but as it has been deemed not dangerous, it has not been fixed. One of the bathroom doors does not close and for a couple of weeks, the light in the other one was not working. There was very little urgency to fix this.Some of my friends are telling me that I should hightail it out of there but I don't know if they're just telling me what I want I want to hear.I've done my best to provide as unbiased an account as possible so that hopefully people here can tell me whether I'm being too sensitive or if my feelings are valid.
v5c9th	1654431823	422	I’m 33M with a partner and 2 young kids in Japan. For the last 7 years give or take I have been at a small manufacturing company in Japan (Kansai). I previously worked in teaching, but I have no plans to go back to that, despite most jobs here for transplants like myself being teaching jobs. After teaching, I worked 2 years in a small design office as a trainee graphic designer with awful pay and a wretched boss, but some of the work was pretty interesting (clients in media, working with web, photography etc)At my current company I started off as a technical writer, then was promoted to doc team leader when our boss retired. A year later, we were merged with the digital marketing team, so I’ve been leading a team handling data sheet/manual/other doc preparation/translation/management, social media/email marketing, and managing a website. This team has 5 established members and 1 new recruit. The lack of manpower means it’s less of a supervisory role, and I’m doing a bit of everything.Long story short, I’m mentally exhausted from keeping all these plates spinning, and I’m feeling a lot of pressure from our colleagues in affiliate companies to increase our output even more. The work pays well enough to support a family, and my partner also works, so we’re comfortable even with a mortgage and car payments. My dilemma is, I don’t want to keep on at this workplace, because I have so much to do and so little support or guidance for the future. I feel I can’t quit because of the family situation. On the other hand, I can’t feel like this for much longer, as I feel it affecting how I spend time with my family already. If I were to look for other work, I’d be happy to work in something creative again. I would like to get back on the design horse and create something in lieu of a portfolio, but I’m seriously low on creative juice right now. Long term, I think creative/design work, or at least something adjacent to that would be satisfying. Language wise, my Japanese is decent (got JLPT N1 10 years ago /humblebrag), so I’m not worried there. When discussing this with my partner, she recommended signing up to a recruitment agency. This might be a way to uncover jobs not on LinkedIn or other open services.Does anyone have experience with mid-career, non-teaching work found through such agencies?Sorry for the long post, but please offer any advice in general or even Japan-specific.Thank you.
v59x4q	1654421851	279	I have studied medicine (and other stuff related to that which adds up to more than 10 years of studying). Already during the study time i felt like this maybe was not for me, but got pushed by family and friends to continue. I have now graduated and worked at a couple of different places, but i feel an internal stress almost all the time at work - even at my current job (which is very calm compared to the others i have had). I dont like to have the responsibility over peoples lifes and im very afraid to do something wrong. I also think i maybe have had a burnout earlier/ADHD/high functioning autism/depression/anxiety since it has been extremely stressful to be new at the jobs i have had. I have felt suicidal, cried at work (cause of stress) and sometimes i have called in sick to get some days of rest (due to depressive symtoms). I also suffer from brainfog, which i have had every now and then for about 7 years now, and its getting worse. Im especially afraid that i would do a mistake when the brainfog is at its worst and hoping that a true emergency wont happen then. I havnt done any real mistake so far though. I dislike my job and feel that i maybe would be happier working with something with less responsiblility, but at the same time i know that those jobs could be really boring for me (i have tried a couple of different jobs during my studies). Afraid i will feel bad no matter what i work with, but think that less responsibility would benefit me. What should i do?
v4grrw	1654315657	1066	Hi folks - I'm new to this subreddit to please do let me know if this isn't the appropriate place to post. I currently have a FT job and am thinking of building up my side hustle as a career coach (I swear this isn't an ad) into something more - would love to hear other people's thoughts.**My background:*** I studied at a top 10 US university, while I was there I worked for 2.5 years as a Writing Tutor at the Student Learning Center. I probably worked with 400+ students one on one on essays from every background for every possible college writing assignment - College Writing 101 midterms, biology honors thesis, scholarship applications, you name it.* Some students from the Writing Center hired me to work with them privately, which is how I got started helping people transfer colleges, apply to grad school, and get their first jobs. I helped with essays, interviews, helping them research programs, teaching them how to write professional emails, and network efficiently. In that period I had 5 notable successes (successful admission into undergrad/grad programs at UC Berkeley, Stanford, and Yale).* After college I got a job working as a private admissions counselor in China, helping international Chinese students apply to top 50 US and UK colleges. I worked one-on-one with 500+ students, from all majors (Engineering, CS, History, Religious Studies, you name it) across all academic levels.* In 2019 I left China and returned to the US, where I joined a VC-backed ed-tech startup selling college counseling as a service to high schools students across the US. I decided to *not* be a college counselor to challenge myself to learn new skills. Instead, I joined the growth marketing team and I've been there ever since. The company is doing really well, I'm Employee #8 and have a higher-level leadership role, and I'm learning a lot in my position so there are many positive aspects to it but... to be honest, I am *not* in love with this company and have been looking for a way out for over a year now.**So what's my side hustle?**I stopped being a counselor partly because of burnout, and partly because it just isn't that much fun for me to work with teenagers anymore. I'm tired of hunting down kids to finish their work, having to call their parents, etc.However, I \*love\* the mentoring work itself. I find it so fulfilling to empower others to see that achieving their goals is really not as hard as they thought. I would do it for free (and I often do), but knowing that I am as good as I am (and since.. I really do want to move on from my FT job soon),I help friends and friends of friends with graduate school applications, and recently have taken on more cases of "actual adults" looking to make career transitions. Here are some profiles of past/current clients:* \[ongoing - worked together 4 years so far\] Psychology student at a top US university who just graduated a year early. I helped him carefully plan all of his college classes and professional experiences - research programs, internships, volunteering, and student clubs. He just graduated with a 3.98 GPA + 2 years research experience + 1 year internship experience at an online therapy startup + several leadership positions in volunteer organizations. He's now interning at a mental health hospital and is well-positioned for his graduate school applications this Fall.* \[complete - worked together 9 months\] Public Relations college senior at a mid-tier university in Shanghai who wanted to study a very competitive masters program in the United States. She had great English and okay grades, but a lackluster resume where she only participated in student clubs or served as a grunt work intern at no-name small Chinese businesses. I helped her get two full-time internships at very competitive international corporations, find an online summer program at UCLA where she tested at the top of her class + got a letter of recommendation from the professor to prove her competence + English ability in her chosen industry, and prepare her actual college applications - she's now starting at her dream masters program this coming fall.* \[ongoing - worked together 5 months\] Chemical engineer/Project Manager in her late 30s who wants to leave China and find employment in an English-speaking country. We meet weekly to go over her progress in networking/job search, write emails/adjust her resume together, and practice interview questions. Obviously, she is way more experienced than I am and has a very technical background, so I mostly serve as a sounding board for feedback and accountability.**Okay, so what do I want advice on already...**(Sorry I know this is long - writing this out is helpful for me though!)I would really love to make a living off of doing what I really love, but so far everything has been through word of mouth and isn't enough to sustain my lifestyle. I will eventually create a website, blog, and social media presence to try to source clients - but before I do I just want to research more about this career path.For anyone who's made it this far (thank you), I'd love your take on any these questions:* Have you used a career coach before? If so - what did you like about it? What was/wasn't helpful? Did you actually achieve your goals?* Would you use a career coach? Why/why not? (Personally - I see a lot a social media ads for career coaches and.. they all just seem so slimy and not genuine.)* One of my biggest drawbacks is that I'm pretty young (I just turned 26). I have 6 years post-college work experience so I'm not fresh off the boat, but I know I need to build a public portfolio of my clients' successes to provide more credibility. I am thinking about reaching out to various online groups I'm a part of and offering free resume/brainstorming sessions - I think this would be a quick way to get experience and testimoanisl, but I also don't want to appear scammy... (I guess my Q is: how do I not appear scammy when I'm this young.)* Has anyone here tried to take their side hustle full time before? Would love to hear your experience!Any other constructive feedback is very welcome! Thanks so much for reading!(Also posting a version of this on r/sidehustle)
v42jga	1654271973	136	I just accepted an offer at a FAANG notorious for burnout and I'm seriously hating myself for it. I feel like I took it for vanity and because it would be a good name on the resume long-term but I am also a new mother and SO terrified of missing out on time with my baby. I was perfectly happy with my current gig where I've been for a few years but things had gotten stagnant and I didn't feel like I was growing. Now I feel like I should have just stayed where I was comfortable. I'm also petrified of having to travel at all and risk bringing home covid to my family.Is there any reassurance or way to feel less scared? Could I decline some of the initial internal travel until my baby is vaccinated?
v2bv1l	1654070897	198	Yesterday I (M29) had a last ‘interview’ with a company I’ve had 3 talks with before. The role is for UI Designer. During all talks they were pretty excited about the prospect of me joining and yesterday they confirmed as well that they would like to make me an offer.I think this job would offer me a lot in terms of gaining experience and especially financially. But I am really scared of taking on the offer.I have a history of mental health issues and I am very scared of falling back into a burnout or stress. Meanwhile right now I am stuck in a job that is extremely low stress but also low paying and I’m not learning a lot.I am pretty much living paycheck to paycheck right now but this new job would almost double my current salary and offer a lot of relief.I am not sure what to do. I am not 100% confident about taking on this new role. It looks good on paper but I cannot trust my feelings anymore and I have fears.I am very scared about not being good enough or not being able to handle the pressure. Or generally just being miserable.
v0mpl4	1653865537	294	Hey everyone. I'm really concerned I may have been pursuing the wrong career. I could use some advice.  I just graduated with my AA degree from a community college.  I was accepted to university for a social work program that I'm supposed to be attending this fall. However, I am incredibly concerned about my student loan debt to the entry-level salary for a BSW ratio. In addition (and honestly, more of my concern), I fear burnout and that my mental health is not stable enough to pursue my passion with the drive that's needed for a great social worker. I struggle a lot with dealing with my own mental health issues, such as PTSD and borderline personality. All I know is that I've felt incredibly inclined to help others from a young age (which I am good at) and I am passionate about social justice and equality advocation. I know that this job would be really rewarding, which is what I need. Furthermore, I have noticed that I do not do well mentally when I work in very mundane environments or where I am not passionate. However, the concern is that I may be taking on too much pressure and not being able to leave my work...at work. &amp;#x200B;In regards to the student loan situation, I would need to take out subsidized and unsubsidized loans to cover my living expenses. In addition to that, I may need to take out a private loan which I really wanted to avoid at all costs. Despite receiving the maximum amount of a Pell grant, I am still short like 35-45k to cover my cost of attendance and living expenses. &amp;#x200B;Does anyone have suggestions on careers very similar to social work without burnout and perhaps better salary?
v0b7j9	1653830940	351	i graduated with a first class degree in law, then worked for a regional firm as a legal assistant for a year but hated it, was treated really badly and suffered from burnout. i've got two gaps on my CV, after i left that job, and around 10 years ago when i left school, i was suffering from mental health problems. both these really affected my confidence and willingness to try new things and push myself sadly.i then went into local government to work in housing administration as a temp, ended up being made permanent, then 4 years later i changed to my current job, where i'm a 'finance officer', also in the housing dept. it's not what i want to do, but i am learning more skills and needed to stop myself getting in a comfort zone.before i had mental health problems about 5 years ago i was close to getting graduate finance jobs (got to final 2 on 2 ocassions but didn't get any), and was contacted on LinkedIn to interview for other jobs ranging from £20-27k that weren't 'graduate jobs' but offered solid careers in national and regional sized companies. i came close in a few of those, but never got over the line and i gave up sadly, if i would have stuck at it i would have got one eventually but can't go back in time.however, i've been given a list of qualifications i can do during work hours, and there's not much there but i could do AAT and ACCA qualifications (level 2-4), as well as data analysis qualifications. other than that, i can build up a bit more experience or so before applying for higher grade jobs within the place i work at but even then the money's low, and barely increasing despite 10%+ inflation. i've wasted a good few years now in local government doing easy work without any stress or challenge, but the pay is poor (my salary range is £22.5k - £25.5k) and i want / need a much higher salary.i really appreciate any advice! whether on qualification routes or job ideas
uzqlkl	1653754569	607	TLDR as this has gotten quite long - incredibly burned out working as a junior banker. Mental health is suffering, don’t know what career actually interests me, struggling to find energy for recruiting even though job opportunities are there. Have enough savings to live off for 6+ months. Thinking about taking some time off to reset, travel and figure out what I want to do. Is it an awful idea to quit without another job offer?For the last two years, I’ve been working as a junior investment banker. The hours have been brutal - I’d say on average 80 hours a week and I can’t remember the last time I didn’t work a weekend. The upside is that it has given me a great stepping stone and I have recruiters messaging me daily with various opportunities. Most junior bankers leave the industry within 2 years and I’d estimate 70% of my cohort have already jumped ship. I’ve been struggling massively with burnout recently and probably mild depression, although I’ve been reluctant to admit it and haven’t had an official diagnosis. Nothing seems to excite me anymore, I’m tired and stressed all the time, feel like I barely have any friends or hobbies, like I’m just coasting through life but without the energy to fix that. I don’t want to stay in banking but I have no clue where I see myself and I can’t seem to find the energy to put effort into recruiting for another role. I also feel like my confidence is at an all time low and, as pathetic as it is, facing rejection from roles would be like kicking me when I’m already down . I’ve been thinking about resigning without another job offer and taking a few months off to relax and reset. I’d like to have some time to travel and it’s always been a goal of mine to live abroad, even if just for a short time. I’m hoping the time away from work will let me think about what I’m truly interested in and where I’d like my next role to be. I’d have time to prep properly for interviews, rather than trying to bullshit my way through having only had enough time to spend 20 mins superficially reading about the industry. I’m wondering if maybe doing something slightly unconventional for a short period of time (interesting volunteer work, unusual travel experience, anything really) could help differentiate myself from every other boring banker whose credentials look identical to mine. Financially, I easily have 6 months worth of expenses in savings and will wait until I get my bonus before quitting. I’d be happy to take a part time role if needed or to plan travel through workaway/similar programs to cut expenses. My parents have told me I can move back in with them rent free if I ever wanted to. I have no real responsibilities - I’m mid 20s, don’t own any property, no partner or kids, nobody who’s dependent on me. I feel like if I don’t do something like this now, will I ever? I don’t want to look back in 10 years time with regrets, thinking I took the easy path and haven’t lived life to the full. My question is basically - is this an awful move? Am I underestimating all the difficulties that would come with trying to find another role while out of work? With the economy taking a big downturn, am I screwing myself over at a stupid time? Should I keep pushing through, accept the next few months will be painful, and try to recruit while still working?Any advice is massively appreciated!
uz473i	1653675052	167	I realise both careers are very different. I have a bachelor's of biochemistry with a minor in psychology, which I liked. I have experience working at a methadone clinic as a pharmacy assistant, which I loved hearing the stories and seeing progress from the patients. I loved that patient interaction! I also have extensive experience working with autism for the entirety of my studies since highschool. I love the aspect of working behind the counter at a pharmacy and helping patients with their healthcare, but I think checking prescriptions and billing medication would get redundant. I love the aspect of working one on one with individuals giving them the tools to communicate &amp; seeing individuals progress, but I think it could get challenging with certain cases which could lead to burnout. I need to pick by next week and im absolutely dreading it. I just want to be happy, have a great work/life balance &amp; help people. For context, im 24 living on the east coast of canada!
uz3a9a	1653672481	78	Looking to switch fields after a decade and need guidance.My background is in the non-profit sector, managing healthcare facilities and working in addictions/mental health. The burnout is real! I made decent money ($5600 approx per month). I’m looking for a career that is in high demand, with a comparable salary. Making more money would be even better as I have two children. I’d gladly sign onto a program or additional post secondary for the right career. Thanks in advance!
uy6a8h	1653567382	502	My Background: I am a professional in the IT field with about 15 years of experience with the majority of that spent in Help Desk/Service Desk. I have two years of experience as a junior level IT projects manager, Five years of documentation experience and one year in firmware testing. About six months ago, I made a major career shift from being an IT projects manager to working in a job that is more aligned with electrical engineering. I have no practical experience in this field at all and the reason that I was hired was because of my stellar reputation in my company. The problem is, I made this career shift after I experienced burnout in my last position and a lot of project work just stopped coming my way. I felt bored and uninspired. I also did not like my work environment and had started to isolate myself from my colleagues. After a little bit of thought, I decided to make my move and do a career switch. My old boss was unconvinced that this would solve anything, telling me that my problems would just follow me into my new job as well. During the honeymoon phase, things in my new job seemed great. I had a lot to learn and I would be kept busy for a while. After a couple of weeks however and things started to change. I had greatly underestimated the learning curve that I was going to have to go through for this job and I didn't take into account that this job can have days where you don't really have much going on. I kinda like something that has a more steady pace with only occasional bursts of hectic. I was getting a feeling in my gut that was telling me that I made the wrong decision. I went on a one week vacation, hoping that with some time I would be able to come back to work and maybe see that it was just pent up stress from not having had a real vacation in three years that was causing me to feel that way. Now I've come back and I still feel the same way about this. After giving it some more thought, I feel that I made my career shift by acting impulsively and not really considering the long term consequences of my actions. I want a job that I feel that I can stick with for at least five years if not more and I don't feel that this position will fit that for me. I see myself either getting extremely bored or burning out again in a year or two. I feel stuck and I'm not sure what I need to do to fix this. I feel kinda bad about leaving this position after some people gave me accomodations to get this job in the first place. But neither do I want to stay in a job or career that isn't fulfilling or makes me happy in the long run.
uy4ov7	1653561561	228	Just seeking some opinions here.I'm a fresh graduate on the lookout for jobs. Recently, I was offered the opportunity to be a journalist with a large media company. I'm keen on it, having done a news internship in my undergrad days, yet I am also confused if I should take up the offer. My main concern is the irregular work hours which I am afraid would affect my mental health. I'm diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and recently my mental health hasn't been great with job search and all that. At my previous internship, I lost a lot of weight and had panic attacks as well (I'm a high-functioning depressed individual, so I rely heavily on medication to keep my mood stable, but seem fine on the outside to many). I've read a lot of stories about journos who suffer from burnout and depression from the irregular hours and stress, and am really afraid of that happening as I am trying to get off my meds. An internship is bearable, but to do it full-time? I have sought advice from my parents, but coming from an Asian household they usually tell me that it is up to me, my decision to make. But I can't do that right now and I need more clarity as I am really confused about this dilemma.Any advice/opinion would be appreciated. Thanks a lot.
uwzkbr	1653422395	255	Really hoping for an outsider's point of view on my situation. I have 8+ years of experience at large tech companies as an analyst but I'm deeply unhappy with my work and want to put in my two weeks with nothing lined up. I have a history of several promotions at each company I've worked with that look really good on paper and I'm not worried financially as I have no debt and have saved up money to not stress with no source of income for a bit.The past year my work has pushed me past a feeling of burnout. I'm working so many hours that my personal life has taken a heavy impact as I work well into the evenings and weekends and I'm feeling the impacts of this job on my physical and mental health.What I do worry about is how can I explain a couple month gap when I feel ready to apply again? Is this a terrible mistake to have a gap and something that will be looked down upon? I know there once was a stigma with leaving jobs but I don't know if that's the case anymore if it's truly a terrible fit.I really just want to reset and hopefully find a position that's much more reasonable in work life balance so that I can feel like I can breathe again outside of work. If you or a friend has done something similar to this I'm really curious to hear how it went or any advice you have for me.
uwyozu	1653420021	78	I’m a 23female. I graduated with a bachelors in psych. I was thinking about becoming a school psychologist and obtaining my masters. But I heard there is high burnout for these individuals. I also looked into hospital administration. I also could see myself doing that as well since there is a lot of diversity. I don’t know which one to pick and I go back and forth. I’ve made a pros and cons list and they basically even out.
uw3opt	1653322008	152	I've been a Math kid™ since childhood, I did have a serious burnout period but I love math and even in the moments I hate it, I still feel an inclination towards *knowing* math very broadly. I lean towards pure math more than applied. I wanna pair it with Economics because I've had some interest in economic/public policy and some economic theory. However everyone says how fruitful degrees in Comp Sci/ tech careers are. It makes me wanna consider it because I come from a poor background and having a cushy job would be real nice. I have very little experience in comp sci besides a Python class, which I found kinda boring. I've also used R, which was more fun -- but I think because we were mapping and using R packages to analyze some research (scientific) I'm interested in. What do you guys think? I'm a high school senior right now.
uu54x7	1653073271	388	[23M] I am in a 5 year Biomedical Engineering program. I started with a ton of ambition and excitement over my future prospects, achieved a 3.9 GPA, got 2 nationally awarded scholarships, etc etc etc. However, starting in  my third year at college 2019 I really started to struggle with burnout, and quarantine classes accelerated that process to full blown apathy.I took a leave of absence my senior year when midway through the first semester I was failing every single one of my classes because I just couldn't be bothered to try. I got a 26% on an exam (lowest grade in the class) and thought it was funny more than anything. I was hoping that the time off from the excessive stress would really help me out, but 8ish months later I still don't find any joy or inspiration in the work nor any motivation or ambition to do well (I am preparing to go back in the fall). It's hard because I no longer feel that it's a mental health thing ; I've been working with a psychologist and psychiatrist for almost 2 years now, and am on some meds that really help my MDD, GAD, and Panic Disorder. I am in some of the best shape of my life because I love working out, I have a great relationship with my girlfriend and family, and have a ton of fun with all my free time, playing videogames, watching hockey, reading history, and going to the bars with friendsBut I just can't find the ambition I used to have in my professional life. I have spent most of my college  coops in research (which I'm trying to escape because academia is so toxic), but hearing what my  classmates have done on their industry co-ops and reading the job descriptions all just sounds excruciating. Even things that I do find professionally exciting - I am a leader of a club that 3d prints prosthetics for kids and have what I believe is a cool idea for a podcast about that - I can never find the motivation to sit down and actually work on themI don't know what I want to do with my life, and I know that's a question I have to answer myself, but how do I go about figuring that out?
ut4cpm	1652969641	263	Hey everyone,So last month, I left my previous employer that I’ve been with for almost 8 years. It is a very large company, more than 10K employees and during my time there, I’ve basically transitioned within 3 times, each role a promotion and have had 4 bosses. You can imagine the skills I’ve learned and the connections I made. I was essentially a “Jack of all trades” and without getting into too much details, the last role in the company I held basically made me a “one person band” developing self-service tools, reports and dashboards for all levels of leadership. I left because this role made me burnout and my boss constantly giving me anxiety. Leaving was the best decision for my mental health and I did not get paid enough for my title to continue staying. Now I’m with a better company, not as large but they have a strong data-driven and people-oriented culture. However, I came from being my own resource and knowing everything to now being a small fish among others who know more and have more experience. I was just in a team meeting the other day, and I felt so out of place, despite knowing my tech skills are up there and I have to remind myself that I’m still new and I’ll be able to showcase my talent soon. I just can’t shake this feeling of self-doubt—I couldn’t sleep because of it. For those who have left a company they’ve been with for years, how long did it take for you find your footing in your new company?
usrq8v	1652922690	406	I [f/29], an INFP (basically an introvert with daydreaming tendencies), and am looking to make a career change. I currently work in a customer-facing position that’s underpaid and depressing. It’s affecting my mental health and I feel so down on myself, especially because I feel like a failure at my age. I was in college for a while but had to drop out due to abuse at home and then life got in the way.I want to have a career where I can earn a good living, one day buy a home, and have money as well as time to travel. Art and travel are my two biggest hobbies. I’d ideally love a job where I can work abroad/from anywhere with no commitment to one location.I’m willing to go back to school or obtain a certification. Once I put my mind to something, I’m determined and prepared to put in hard work. I just need a change. I’m brainstorming ideas and could use some suggestions. I’ve thought about graphic design, web design, coding, archaeology and archival (it seems fascinating but I heard it does not pay well), or going to school to become a therapist.Things I want in a job/career:- ideally something I can learn in my free time while working a regular job to pay my bills- flexibility in my schedule/ability to work anywhere- the chance to use my creativity and/or artistic talents (unless the pay is amazing and I have time to pursue my creative interests in my free time)- being able to hyper-focus, fully immerse myself in a project, and work at my own pace- decently high earning potentialMy skills/talents/interests:- visual art, writing, comedy- working with my hands- learning everything there is to learn about a special interest very quickly and retaining it (example: I source antiques to flip as a hobby and love it)- I learn languages easily- when it’s something I’m interested in, I’m tenacious and always find a way to accomplish it- I put people at ease/have a “gentle” energy (a lot of people tell me I should be a therapist, but I’m worried about compassion fatigue/burnout)- I’m exceptionally patient and calm under pressureThings I’m bad at:- admin work (I have really bad ADHD)- sales/persuading people- office politicsI know there’s no silver bullet or else everyone would do it. But is there a career path that sounds like it could be the best possible fit for me?Thank you for reading this!
usrit6	1652922022	338	To preface this post, I am also an artist, rather successful but still up and coming - I have releases on several big labels coming up  as well as support from major industry people in my genre and things could take off at any point - but that could be as soon as this summer or in a year or two. I am planning to keep working for it rather than planning to blow up off a viral hit. Plus, the first couple years as an up and coming artist can be financially so it would really be nice to have a remote job I could do on the side. However, I am currently extremely burnt out by my job in civil engineering. A big part of the burnout is I have to bill my time in 15 minute increments, which makes it really stressful especially for something I really don't enjoy. I live in Los Angeles and make $75k a year. I live a relatively comfortable life but would really like to stop worrying about finances - I think an increase to even just $90-100k would be perfect. I have experience in a multitude of softwares including AutoCAD, Civil3d, microstation, as well as some entry level knowledge of MATLAB and C/C++. I also have 4+ years experience learning Logic and how to produce music all myself and I think that shows strong initiative.I've been told that engineers can transition to other industries fairly easily with their critical thinking ability, but my biggest challenge seems to be that all the roles require at least 3-5 years experience in that field. I feel confident in my ability to do virtually any job involving a computer - especially something like a data analyst as I am very strong in math - and I'm a very very fast learner, have always been praised as such in school and jobs.I'm focusing on trying to apply to data analyst positions for now, but what could be some other good options? Almost definitely remote
usn9yu	1652909266	250	I am severely burnt out as a tech PM. Today, I could barely get out of bed and just decided not to attend any video meetings. Couldn't get myself to read or send any emails. Today's the worst, but I have been considering my departure for a while now (1+ years)* Currently:   * still working remote but hate my job - it is both stressful and boring and I feel like I lack support. I'm also not using nor growing my skillset. Been here 4 years.   * Some team members are awesome - They are good friends   * Manager and I are on transactional terms. They're not a bad person or bad manager. I just don't think they're an exceptional manager either. We just don't click.   * Currently starting interviews - in process with 5 companies* 1 month from now:   * I get another RSU vest (worth about $20k) - vesting happens quarterly   * Annual Performance review comes in - might get a promotion and raise   * Hopefully will get offers from at least 1 of the companies I'm interviewing at.   * Tech industry is pulling back hard - hearing of layoffs and hiring freezes&amp;#x200B;Some options:* Take a 2 weeks of vacation now and focus on recuperating and interviewing?* keep working and interviewing* Resign and keep interviewing* Resign and take a break for a month or two and start interviewing again.&amp;#x200B;What else should I consider?
us475w	1652846135	555	I'll try to keep this as brief as possible. I started what I would consider very closely my dream entry role position at a very reputable company. My interview process was very strange in the sense that it was in four stages: recruiter, would-be manager, would-be cohorts, then SVP. I had a great interview with 3 out of 4 of them but the interview with my would-be manager went about as terrible as you could expect. She was short, unemotional, devoid of warmth, and objectively unpleasant to be around. I chalked this up to her being in a bad mood since the hiring manager said she had glowing things to say about me. Fast forwarding, I accept the job with a salary I believe is very fair and I'm happy with the work-life balance. I get to WFH 4 days a week, and go out into the field every so often as well. However this is when the trouble starts. On the first day of the job I'm told that I will be trained in pieces over the coming weeks so as to not overwhelm me. At first thought that sounds logical and like a good idea. The issue arises when they begin teaching me all these different things that don't tie into one another yet because I haven't learned "the bigger picture" so it feels as though I've been given a Lego set without any pieces. And it's all non-sequential too. For example, I'll learn "step E" of this process on the first week, then "step C" of an entirely different responsibility two days later, then "part B" of the first process two weeks later. And that's been going on for five weeks now while still being partially trained. All the while I am having to pick up where the role was previously vacated in February and plan things as far out as July while simultaneously still being trained.The cherry on top is, my manager never became more sympathetic or helpful. We have gone over my expectations and responsibilities ONCE on the conceptual level without executing any of them. So I am constantly scorned in front of others in my department and asked "Why I don't know that already" or "why hasn't this been done yet you should know this". I don't want to bother my teammates because they are busy with their own projects but at the same time I am genuinely scared to seek guidance from my manager since I get a lashing every time I do.So here I am at a loss on what to do next. I genuinely enjoy the job itself, the company's salary and benefits, and the work style. However I feel as though I can do no right through my boss' eyes. I also can't afford to just NOT have an income either but conversely I don't want to be fired/terminated from my first legitimate job. I just feel like I haven't been given an honest chance to settle in and really figure everything out yet.I would love to hear some advice from those who have experienced a similar situation or anyone who believes they can shine some wisdom and perspective on the situation. It's causing me A LOT of stress and anxiety and I'm already feeling myself withdrawal from the job and experiencing burnout.Please, please, PLEASE, help!

urzjsc	1652830694	259	So i recently transitioned from a really fast paced private mechanical contracting company where i was the lead technician, to federal employment.  I made the transition due to burnout and serious concerns as to the company trajectory that were not properly addressed (gave 6 months notice to my previous employer).  Long story short i made the right move and like the guys i work with and the pay/benefits are top notch.  I just don't know what the heck to do with myself outside of work.  I've been at the new job for ~a month now and all the things i used to do to unwind i don't find interesting.  It used to be i'd be working 60-80 hours a week and i'd come home and squeeze in an hour or 2 of gaming with the pals or on a rare day or 2 off i'd binge a show or game it up.  Now i can't seem to concentrate on it for more than about 5 minutes before i get all restless.  It generally winds up with me puttering around and not doing anything or mindlessly browsing videos, sometimes even just laying in bed for hours till i'm tires enough to sleep.Anyone else had this happen or have an idea what could be going on?  I've tried talking to my buddies about it, but they don't really grasp it (not that i do myself) so i figured i'd ask here if anyone knew what this phenomenon is and what could be the cause.
urxrb7	1652825306	444	I've been a pharmacist for 9 years now, and have been at the same job for the last 7 years. All 7 years have been so excruciating, but I was young and naive and I kept telling myself that I could continue to keep it up.My job is extremely stressful, and I don't know if somebody who doesn't work in healthcare can truly ever understand the magnitude of it. It's a combination of stress from being forced to work at a very fast and unsafe speed due to high workload (the worst part being that for 9+ hours I am hoping I didn't make a life threatening mistake), being used as a verbal punching bag by patients yelling at me every day, zero support from management, and constantly feeling like I'm just a highly paid robot forced to meet metrics.Finally, 3 months ago, I decided to take a leave from work due to extreme burnout. I was crying almost every day on my way home from work, I didn't feel alive anymore. I could barely function, I wasn't keeping up with personal hygiene and couldn't get out of bed in the morning. I was so angry at everything in the world.My leave is about to end in 2 weeks and the thought about going back to work is so dreadful. I was hoping to have a new job by the end of my 3 month leave but I honestly just spent the last 2.5 months trying to feel like a human again.I really want to quit and not go back but I'm really scared because I'm hearing about all these big tech company layoffs and how a recession may be around the corner in the U.S. On top of all this, the pharmacist job market is already extremely saturated due to an influx of new pharmacist grads from all the new pharmacy schools opened. There are too many pharmacists and not enough jobs, also the starting salary has actually gone down from when I first became a pharmacist due to the saturation.Not sure if it would be a bad idea to quit at this time with a potential recession looming overhead, part of me says I should just suck it up because I'm so afraid of not finding a better job for a very long time. Also as much as people say healthcare is a stable profession, healthcare in America is a business first and foremost and for profit at the end of the day.For context, I am married (my husband has a stable job) with no kids and currently have about 6 months worth of liquid savings. Any advice is appreciated at this time.
urxpus	1652825192	192	Hi all,I was a contractor at a company for 4 months during which I really enjoyed the work. I accepted an offer at the same company to be a full time employee, which ended up lasting only 3 months, as I recently impulsively quit with no notice due to what I now know was burnout, which had lasted for the 3 months I was a full time employee, due to self-imposed poor work-life balance.I'm now seeing a therapist to help recover from the burnout and the issues that led me to experiencing it. I would have loved to stay at the same company in the same role, but I couldn't continue the way I was feeling. It's been about three weeks and I'm immensely regretting my decision. Which I know was a poor decision, and I should have sought help sooner, or even considered medical leave, but I didn't consider these options at the time and just tried to push through. Similar roles at other companies look for multiple years of experience, and with little experience as well as no connections from my previous role, I'm not sure where to go from here.Thanks
uru2h1	1652815267	138	I'm feeling fucked up. So bad period in my life, I hate my job, I hate myself. I don't have friends and I want to do nothing, I'm feeling lost in relationship, career and life, I need to break.... but world did not stop, I'm leaving my job after two weeks, but I afraid for my future that I can't find job anymore. I'm working in the design field, and I feel like burnout. I don't like what I do, and I think others do not like it because I'm such a black person. In my mind, only sad, bad vibes, so how could I create something beautiful if it felt like this? I want to disappear..... What to do I don't know anymore everything what I touch or do - everything gone ruin and fail.I'm 26 years old.
urga3s	1652769284	68	I've done over 200 total interviews over 2 months- some rejections, some I turned down. My current job is untenable and I'm pursing legal action, which is insanely stressful. Still dealing with long-COVID effects. I'm taking it day by day and making progress but I'm SO tired. Advice on combatting burnout from multiplesources?? It's starting to affect my interviews even after taking a break, obviously not good. Texas. USA
ur9ac3	1652744451	125	I'm in kind of a rut and would like some advice.I have an auditor job that usually has a variety of work to do so it was interesting. Lately I got on this project that has me doing data entry a lot for the next few months. This has be feeling unmotivated and burnt out. To make it tougher I work in a room by myself and they company is not tracking how much I do. So if my work output goes down nobody cares.What are some things that help get motivated again when you have a long project at a computer? I listed to music with headphones and that helps some. It just seems like a journey that will never end. Thanks for your advice.
ur1um8	1652723722	135	This is my first "real job". I love my field of work, I think my current company is interesting, really like my coworkers, make significant impacts, have chances for career development, etc. But... Blame it on burnout, pandemic fatigue, a poorly-timed series of frustrating incidents, whatever. I've been considering quitting. In previous jobs, this thought never subsided until I finally gave up and quit. I usually regretted the time I stayed at said jobs dwelling on the decision. Difference is, those were minimum-wage service jobs that I never intended to spend significant time at, and this is an actual career with future prospects. Has anyone felt like quitting, only to change their mind and enjoy their job again? If so, how did you do it? Or is there no turning back once you get the itch?
uqdc4w	1652642446	381	Hi,  I'm 27, I live in Belgium. I have a bachelor’s degree in French teaching (to be clear, in Belgium, to become a teacher in primary and the first three years of secondary school, you just need a bachelor’s degree. You have it by studying in a college university, which is different from "classical"university) and a master’s degree in educational sciences. I'm currently working as a teacher in college uni to form future teachers. I like some part of the job (teaching, helping students, "bonding" with them), but I also hate a part of it (administrative work, some students that seems cool but make a complaint or even trial you when they fail the exam, etc.)From September to March, I also worked part-time as an assistant lecturer at university, because I wanted to start a PhD. I hated the job, did all the boring and ungrateful tasks for the lecturer and was "allowed" to work on my thesis only on weekends and after my day. I also had a very bad relationship with my bosses. I was almost in burnout so I decided to quit and get the full job in college. I'm thinking a lot about my future career path. My job at college is not sure for next years. My goal has always been to get a PhD, and I'm thinking of doing it in another field than educational sciences (I'm working on students' spelling, so maybe someone in the language field could be interested). But that first experience was awful and that will to get the diploma is a lot about ego. So I'm thinking about changing my career path, maybe opening in herbalism shop. I always loved plants (did a first year of biology at uni before becoming a teacher and got a 16/20 on botanic). In Belgium, we don't have a degree about that, anyone can open this kind of shop, but you can take a 2-year course in staggered hours to learn about plants and how to manage a business. That seems cool and fulfilling but I know nothing in management and I'm afraid of  bankruptcy . What do you think? I'm a bit lost, but I tried to be complete and explain it all... (Sorry for the English, that's not my mother tongue)|||||:-|:-|:-|||||
upc17s	1652513268	444	Hey all, first post here. Nice to meet everyone! 👋 😊I'll make this as short as I can because otherwise I could write an essay: 😅• I'm at a cross-roads, recently medically barred from military entry, and now seeking to head straight into my long-term career goals of healthcare (specifically nutrition);• I will NOT become a BDA Dietician - I intend to study Functional Nutrition and later Functional Medicine and create my own practice for this. I won't get into why, but the BDA Nutrition Guidelines highly limit practitioners and are based on falsified, dogmatic, or weak epidemiology-founded (or conflict of interest-ridden) "recommendations" that are counterproductive for progress and best client outcomes in the field;• I would still love to gain the scientific knowledge and job opportunities open to healthcare professionals, and I am genuinely compassionate and entering this field to help others;• Honestly, my life goals and personal circumstances don't align with the most high-stress and unhealthy specialisations (burnout is undoubtedly a massive problem), though I respect all those who do work I such fields;• I'm about to turn 21 and would have to do an Access to Science or Access to Medicine Diploma first before making a med school application... So basically I'm late (Big concern of mine)...;• Gastroenterology, Endocrinology, GP, or Psychology interest me most as they are all areas highly affected by Nutrition and overall lifestyle, which is what I want to focus on to help people;• The debt is scary. The job aspects aren't. The pathway seems extremely rewarding (academically, personally, and monetarily);• I would like to work online or abroad in AUS 🇦🇺, NZ 🇳🇿, or SP 🇪🇸 in the future;• I would definitely consider military medical or reserves later once I'm over my current condition still. HOPEFULLY I'll be eligible and apply for the British Army Medical Bursary or Royal Navy Cadetship, which are incredible deals and help fund a large amount of the study costs.In short, for UK med school students, am I too late? Is the debt worth it for you? Is the lifestyle justified for you or too stressful to recommend (and do you feel a bit "robbed" of your 20's)? Also, are the specialisations I mentioned recommended at all for the prospects and lifestyle and ability to help people, or do you have any knowledge or experience of these fields specifically? Finally, what's it like trying to earn a living or survive during your studies as they progress?Truly, all advice and info will be wholeheartedly appreciated and I have a lot of respect for all med students and experienced professionals in this industry.Thank you so much for advance. 🙏 Have a wonderful day!Best Regards,James
uoih34	1652411897	207	Currently, I am a Middle School Teacher who has done well in the classroom. I have earned praise from administrators, parents, and most importantly my students. However, after 6 years, I have decided to leave Education because (1) I feel often powerless in big decisions, (2) I want to have greater control over my work environment, (3) and I want to be in a field that better utilizes my skills ( I teach ELA, but have two history degrees). So, I have decided to go back to school and work toward an Engineering degree. However, as I finish up my last few weeks I don’t feel celebratory. Rather, I feel sad. My students and their parents joke about me returning and working in the high school and my admin have expressed how I have been an great educator. Like many teachers across the country, I feel the public service burnout - but it doesn’t affect me as much as it does others. Further, I am fine with my pay. Am I making a mistake by completely switching out of a career that I have done well in but have questionable passion? Or should I migrate to new frontiers, start a new field, and start over at age 30-31?
uo0klf	1652360574	322	The industry is changing from educated professionals to a team of minimally trained, minimally paid people doing assembly work, while the watchmaker handles their problems. We are chronically understaffed, and management solution is mandatory overtime, every month, for the last two years with no end in sight. I love the work, and up until the start of the pandemic, I assumed that I would happily retire from the company. The options I have are- There’s  another major service center in my area, but they have a lot of the same problems my current employer has, with a longer commute. I could probably go the retail store route, but the stores that carry brands of the level I’m used to are in areas that would require a similar long commute, and I wouldn’t get the vacation, if any, that I’m used to. Currently about 7 weeks (I know I won’t get that anywhere). But the pay can be significantly higher, like 30-60%.I could take in repairs to my home workshop. I already do a few a year, but full time would require more insurance, better equipment ($$$), and all the other things that go into starting and running a business (that part I know very little about).Move. This is my least favorite idea for now. I have high school/college age kids, and want to give them a place to come home to when they need it. Probably won’t feel comfortable moving for at least five more years.Change careers. Avionics repair is a similar discipline but the pay is about the same with less industry support for diagnostic and tooling. A friend is suggesting trying to become a flight attendant. That might be cool, but I don’t really like the idea of so much time away from family. No idea is too dumb. I like the idea of a professional customer service type atmosphere as I enjoy doing things that make peoples lives easier.

unrzda	1652327199	188	Has anyone quit a good career in order to take a lower-level ‘day job’ to have more time to pursue their dreams?I recently quit a ‘career job’ that I got after finishing my college degree, and I’m unsure if I’ve made the right decision. The degree itself was my Plan B so I had something to fall back on if Plan A didn’t work out.Thing is, Plan B ended up taking so much of my time which left me too burnt out to even pursue Plan A! So, I quit.I ended up accepting a job in a call centre because it was evening shifts only, which lets me have more time to pursue my real passion during the day. It’s also fully work from home which is perfect for me.Ironically, since quitting and accepting a lower-level job for the sake of flexibility, I’m now getting a bunch of other offers for high-powered companies that are really tempting, but I’m scared I’ll get stuck in the same cycle of burnout.Am I throwing everything away? How do you choose the right ‘day job’ to allow you to pursue your career goals?
um1xgl	1652131951	231	I'm in my early fifties and interested in a possible career change into web development for which I've started self study. I've looked at different IT fields and it seems that web development is a better option because of several factors including the amount of job openings, flexibility and it doesn't require a bachelors in CS.I have an IT Associates Degree and certificates in networking and have progressed to a senior management position and have acquired a large skill set over the years but where I haven't advanced is in a specific IT path and I am desiring to get back into something more technology focused.I'm not looking to do anything drastic like quit my job and may even be interested in doing it part time to get started.I've read plenty of articles and posts and know that it's possible but feedback from others who have **transitioned to web dev/tech later in life** or **anyone having experience** hiring for this field would be appreciated.I want to have realistic expectations regarding hiring, salary and advancement opportunities at my age.My concerns are that it may be to late to start down this path or that the skills required to keep up will quickly lead to burnout. If there are other tech jobs that are better suited for a mid-life career that doesn't require years of retraining please feel free to mention them as well.
um1dy8	1652130513	383	I've been working remotely at my current PR/comms job for nearly three years now. I do content strategy-related work for technology companies. I was really excited about it when I first landed the job. I was a year out of college, and a friend of mine told me it was a great place to get skills before moving on to something better. I spend most of my time writing blog posts, press releases, and internal marketing materials for our clients.Unfortunately, my passion has been dwindling over the past few months. I haven't received a single promotion since joining. My managers often point out flaws in my work: I sometimes miss the mark with my deliverables, I don't communicate enough to their standards, and my quality of work doesn't meet their expectations. I feel set back when I receive feedback like this. My managers have told me that my performce is inconsistent and not worthy of a promotion, and they questioned today if I enjoy my job. It was a frightening topic because I fear they notice my lack motivation and that I'm at the brink of losing my job. It's true that I don't enjoy it very much. I go through phases of trying really hard to get a promotion and then feeling burnout—something they've noticed and contributed to my inconsistency. I don't want to take pity; it's true that I need to work on those skills and apply myself. I have applied for similar roles, but I don't receive any offers after interviewing. I also fear that my dispassion will follow me if I leave for a similar role. I am considering taking a turn with my career endeavors. I'm looking into technical writer, project management, program management, or even outdoor recreational and community planning roles. I would like to work on gaining more valuable skills (perhaps involving programming/coding, project management, UX design, time management, etc.), and I don't think I'm fully getting that within my current role. It feels like I'm at a crossroads with my career. I need to make a change, and I think I'd benefit from chatting with a career specialist, taking some trainings, and rediscovering what motivates me. Where do I start? Should I go back to school? Has anyone ever felt this way while in their mid-twenties?
ulc516	1652046640	117	I have a Masters of Science in Clinical Mental Health Counseling and a Bachelor of Science in psychology. I currently am a therapist in community mental health. I love what I do,  but I honestly don't know how long I'll actually want to be in therapy given the rate of burnout. I was wondering what it would take for me to be able to teach community College or undergrad psychology or sociology or something of the like? I do not have any education credits but I was wondering if anyone knew if it was possible for me to just get an education certification or something without having to go back for a whole other bachelor's degree? TIA
ukez8k	1651935245	224	Hi, I got a new job and it unfortunately a very bad experience. From day 1 it was clear that it‘ll be a bumpy onboarding. It wasn’t just that, it even went as far as working 60-70 hrs was normal due to several teams being understaffed.In addition, the company’s in a huge transition with people being in unclear situations over months whether or not they‘re going to be layed off. Which created a very stressful, hostile and chaotic work environment on top of everything.Long story short, I knew this wasn’t the right company for me so I looked for alternatives and eventually found a new job/signed a new contract.Nevertheless this environment took a hard toll on my mental and physical health. It started with neglecting my mental and physical health routines.. I was depleted of any energy so I skipped yoga, sports, even going out/meeting friends, and finally having huge sleep problems. At the moment I’m in my final work weeks (still 2-3 weeks left at that company) and experience problems to stay concentrated/focused, feeling completely burnt out … I‘ll start at the new company Mid of June - so do you have any advice on how to get back my energy levels so I can restart my good old habits again and get back to normal/healthy levels of focus and productivity?Thanks for any advice
ujr850	1651854261	425	Hi guys, I'm a 22 yr old CS student, 2-3 years experience in the mobile development scene working project by project. Recently I've been feeling like as each day passes the more closer I get to completely being disinterested in what I do. This may in turn lead to burnout and its almost getting scary. I'm going days without writing a single line of code since most of the time I feel like it doesn't bring new value/knowledge/insight into my life rn. I'd then complete my weeks task in the last two days before submission. I feel like its a bit common people getting bored in their jobs but for me I'm not sure what next to explore after I complete the mobile scene. How many of y'all have experienced this?I've got 3 options stuck in my subconscious for a while now. Those with great experience in the field please suggest others.- Blockchain Dev - Starting off with Smart Contracts seems like a fairly simple way to begin my transition into web3 as its just refining logic we now write. I also have a good interest in cryptocurrencies. Problem with web3 is we're all not entirely sure when mass adoption will hit and we might be 'underground' (for lack of a better word) for quite some time.- DevOps - The idea of DevOps also excites me a little. I look at learning full-blown DevOps as the final ring of completing the software development scene. This could also help in transitioning to a senior role in not only the mobile scene but also could open possibilities in completely different fields in tech. This could be my no. 1 option.- Data Science - All that data jargon has been sounding exciting &amp; lucrative since I first joined Uni. A completely different field from what I'm in rn. I've never been the guy to be impressed by large amounts of rows and columns and different types of charts and all. I'd love to. I feel like this is a field that would be nice to say I work in, but wouldn't be fun for me, hopefully I get to develop that if I choose this.Blockchain, DevOps, Data Science, possibly some few  more, could interest me for the next couple of years before I get bored of them again lol. Have y'all ever felt this way in your current career path?Please help me decide. Let me know your experiences and how you made, or are planning to make, that leap into a more advanced sub-field. Thanks in advance, Reddit.
ui1mfr	1651651608	315	I have a major career decision to make and want to know if you all have any advice before making my final decision. I (27M) was enjoying but feeling a bit trapped in my current gig (non-profit, education), so when my friend referred me for another position that did very similar work (in agriculture) I applied and ended up getting the offer. The new opportunity pays about 10K more but the big thing that stood out was that the last two to hold the position became a CEO and a high ranking USDA official respectively. It seems like a place with good people and would be a solid stepping stone. The workload seems a lot heavier though (possible burnout) and I’d need to be in an office 5 days a week when not traveling. I also don’t have an Ag background. My current job is all remote and the schedule is way more flexible. I accepted the offer thinking that my current gig wouldn’t counter, but they did. Their counter was 5K higher than the offer I received and they said they would work closely with me to get me where I want to be down the road so I’m not stagnant in the position. I don’t know what that would be, and I worry that by taking this counter I’ll end up feeling trapped again and ruin a chance to break into a large industry. Should I take a risk and leave to go to a different industry for slightly less money in hopes of more upward mobility in a prominent industry? Or stay where I’m at for slightly more money, have a more flexible schedule, burn a bridge into the Ag industry, and hope that there’s still a path for upward mobility in my current gig? Any input or advice would be greatly appreciated. Also happy to answer any questions and give clarifying details.
uhze6i	1651641785	268	Hello! We are going absolutely out of our mind trying to research and endless stress trying to figure this out for the past like 10 years! My husband wants a life change immediately at 40+, and HOW??? He likes Land Surveying and has done it for 15 years, but he has always loathed the bosses, the deadlines, the team managing, etc that always comes with a construction industry type business.  So now, after losing 2 jobs cause of overwhelm/burnout and about to lose another, we must find a way for him to make $, work only like 5 hours a day and lots of vacation time. Quick-  what we've done... he's going now to a phycologist for the stress, been to several life coaches who basically give mantras, better thoughts, breathing techniques and listen. Whenever I try to get him to go to a career coach, he turns it down because he says he doesn't want another "career". He doesn't want a job. He doesn't want to make a business or own a business.  He basically wants to do hobbies, sit around and volunteer. Which I would be fine with IF we had the money to retire early!! I'm completely at a loss and beyond over the endless talking and fights about it.  Hence, why I'm here!! Any ideas on ways to make money - in the Land Surveying field... but not for a company or his own business- (because he would enjoy his work) OR ways to make money that aren't a career/job or a Business? (And not risky, illegal or immoral ;)) TIA!
uhxuvw	1651636058	103	Currently making $120K/year as a contractor. The work is relatively stressful and is very demanding (if they say jump, you jump no matter what) and there isn't a ton of support. Contract technically ends in August. I'm potentially receiving an offer in the coming week for a permanent role at a different company for $80K/year. Work would be relatively easy (and I'm a bit more passionate about the line of work this is) and ultimately a LOT more flexible in terms of work/life balance. Both are remote, but ultimately I'm feeling the burnout even in such a short time on my contract role. Thoughts?
uhnf5s	1651604953	180	I'm current facing some serious burnout and I'd like to take some much needed time off, possibly up to a year.  However, I'm really struggling with letting go of my job. Not because I like it. In fact, I actually hate my job. But I've always been told that employment gaps are the worst possible thing that could happen to someone and that gaps that span over 6 months should be avoided at all costs. I'm at a point where I honestly don't care if I get another job for a while. I'm thankfully in a financial position to be without work for roughly 2 years before my funds start to dwindle. I currently work as an engineer and have over 5 years of experience. I've been burnt out since my second year working as an engineer and have been operating off of fumes for the last 3. I just can't take it anymore. For those of you who've taken some substantial amount of time off work, how has it turned out for you? How difficult was re-entering the workforce?

ugecug	1651454554	366	Hey guys!I’m 23 and I’ve been on my gap for exactly a year now. I figured out my bachelor’s degree is the furthest thing from what I actually want to do. I love helping people and connecting with others, doing things that challenge me while being able to fuel a little competitive streak I have. Problem is, my social work job as a case manager was awful and I realized that the burnout isn’t worth it. Law school was always the dream after the gap, but I’ve been on hiatus because I seriously have no clue if it’s for me on further inspection.Every lawyer on here says to either not do law, or be absolutely 100% positive before going to law school. Thinking on it, while I have the classic “love to argue” (model UN was one of the most fun things I’ve ever done), I’m pretty honest about wanting to make good money, and I have some really strong writing and people skills, I have some glaring flaws that might make me struggle. I have a hard time digging deep in articles for research, I have a short attention span, My time management is whatever, I have a dog so working 70+ hours a week may not work, and I get bored easy.Im trying desperately to get a job in a legal office, but I’m stuck in a smaller town, and the cities around me have like 4 openings each. Im trying to work with a staffing agency but it’s incredibly difficult.Stat wise I have a super strong GPA (3.96) from a top public school, but my extracurriculars are kinda bad. I have decent rec letters and I haven’t taken the LSAT yet.What do I do? How do I find if this is for me?**TL;DR** Stuck choosing a career. Planned on using my social work degree for a year before law school, been super hesitant and learned I hate social work. Good people and writing skills, love to critical think and argue, but easily distracted, hate doc review, and gets bored easy. Struggling to find a job even through a temp agency. Have the stats to find a good school, but don’t know what to do.
ugdv4o	1651452932	541	I was recently terminated from my job as a junior environmental artist at a bottom barrel industry job, and I'm unsure of my future. Just wanted some guidance from others, especially those who have faced similar situations.Little background: the company was a crowd funded video game studio that was essentially creating vaporware. They had "big plans" but absolutely zero follow through or... Plans. I was enthusiastic at first because my dream had been to work on an MMORPG that I'd be proud to tell people about, but the first 3 months after my UNPAID internship, I had received zero payment for my work. Other artists almost went on strike because I wasn't being paid for my time. It was resolved after that, but that was just the tip of the shit sandwich that would be my time there. I know some will say I'm stupid for sticking around with it after that and I agree with you, BUT given the context at the time, it makes more sense... In my mind, at least. I was a fresh graduate just as COVID had started wreaking havoc. I literally remember hearing about how all classes would be online next quarter after giving my final presentation on my senior project. My friend, who graduated a year prior, offered me a position, contingent on an internship period,  where he worked. I was uncertain of the future with a pandemic looming, and I had student debt collectors on the edge of their seats, thirsty for their due. So, with the idea that a foot in the door is a foot in the door and money is money, I took the leap into the shit pile.That being said, I was unable to keep up with their management style, or lack thereof, and it really burned me out. I've had some horrible retail-work experiences when I was younger, but this "industry level" job was the absolute worst I've had. It drained all the enthusiasm I had for the work. I know this is probably an edge case and could be a case for 'what to look out for in the future', but I'm still having a hard time emotionally trying to jump right back into the work and that field. The desire to do the work is still there in some capacity, but honestly I'm considering other routes because of it. I'm trying to take time for myself and reset from the burnout, but bills never stop showing up so not working is not an option. I don't have much experience for other work outside the field I studied for, so finding work to keep the lights on has been troubling so far. So, I'm at this weird point of do I just push through the burnout to try and get a job in the industry that caused me so much unnecessary stress or do I try to work lower paying jobs to try and keep my head above water and find any kind of R&amp;R that I can while I can and maybe try other areas of interest?This is a really niche situation, but I'm sure someone can relate to something I'm going through. Any advice or kind words are absolutely appreciated. Thank you kindly in advanced.
ug87hy	1651435719	817	“I can’t use my brain this moment but can again soon” Practically my exact words to my director, and I feel like it was a dumb move, even if it was honest.It’s been a rocky two years at work. I started as a new employee in a “mean girls” office. It was a disaster, and I let the bullying get to me (fail, I know).  How they managed to carry it on remotely is a gold standard for demoralization.  I morphed from a respected employee to an apathetic one.  Between the rampant burnout and their antics, it’s like my mind decided subconsciously one day, “You think I’m a pos?  Alright, you’ll get one” and self sabotaged my standards into whatever low thing they had decided I was. I became distrustful of anything they said or did.  It’s a loss for us both. I couldn’t leave at that point. While they were getting me at work my personal life was also imploding, invading every part of my world.  I could tell my leadership team was frustrated and didn’t believe me, resenting me even more.  Only when the death toll started or they were personally humbled by life, did some of them lighten up and realize I wasn’t exaggerating.  They aren’t as cruel to me now, but it’s weird and again, I can’t trust them yet.The main bully was just promoted to director.  Director is a master manipulator. Sometimes I think she really gets it, while other times she seems like a predator pretending to be human.  She called me into a 1:1 meeting and said they want to reevaluate our PDQs. They just hired some new people, and she wants to ensure people are happy and doing exactly what they want.  She acknowledges I’m still contending with a lot outside of work.  We talk about removing some of my current tasks, which I’m grateful for and honestly need.  She says they shouldn’t have been mine to begin with and just got dropped on me.  But then all of the extra tasks are removed too, so I start getting nervous. (Some of the old bullying tactics were isolation based.)I said how I don’t want to be an employee with no value on your team.  She’s acting pleasant and supportive the whole time. I’m torn between distrust and this growth opportunity and chance to repair.  I choose to let my guard down and put it all out there. I say how our work environment coupled with my own stuff has left me with no more mental space.  Discussed how I am clawing my way back from apathy and burnout. Sure, the data shows students love me but we both know other areas have suffered. I say right now, in this moment, I can be a work horse advisor - a to-do person, not a thinker, a marketer, not developer.  I say how in the past I could but how now “I can’t use my brain at the moment but can again soon.”  She asks without malice but with hesitation if I’m not this or can’t do that, what can I do?  We find what I think is a middle ground.  We actually hug? I leave the office relieved and actually feeling supported. Dread sets in, and I feel like I overshared to the wrong person.  I fear this might give them cause to target and eliminate me vs support. All of my distrust floods back. I remember who she really is and every slight she ever made. Note - I’m in the States at a university, so culturally, the more you take on the more respect you get despite this being toxic.  Work is not what defines me anymore, especially after the year I’ve had.  A grant is paying for my masters so I’m hesitant to leave right away and other depts aren’t hiring. I’m with them for now. TL; DR: Toxic work environment for a couple years destroyed all trust. Workplace bully is now my boss. PDQ getting reworked and tasks removed. I admitted to boss I was burnt out in a meeting and fear this will make it worse down the road, not better.  Wondering if being honest was damning or helpful.  Random questions:1.  Has anyone been in a similar position? What was the outcome?2. Should I have been less direct?  3.  If there is retaliation and a negative outcome, what next steps would you take if you had to stay? 4. Does Director seem sincere?  Sometimes when people are promoted they get their shit together and find a heart. 5.  When distrust is this bad, can it be fixed or is it best to try to leave the workplace for all our sakes? Thanks for any insight.
ufl5l0	1651356104	323	**Internship 1:** I am already in this internship doing a lot of what would be considered busy work in my field. I am very career-driven, and this internship is not sharpening my skills. Pros:* Pays well* great people (one's I do not want to burn bridges with because they are so cool)* great culture*  possibility of more responsibilities in the future* possibility of staying on through senior year and converting full time after graduationCons:* Small company* my work is busy work* both of the possibilities are not certain (although my manager almost guarantees them)**Internship 2:** Same field, more strategic work and consulting. defined timeline with specific projects that I get ownership of and more focused toward career development. I haven't applied here yet but it is likely I would get accepted.Pros:*  pays very well* Seems to have a great culture* Fortune 100* clear career development* would look great on the resume and help me build new skillsCons:* only for the summer* less of a promise about future employment &amp;#x200B;I think what I will do is apply to number two and see if it works out and then decide but it is so tough. I really love the people at number 1 and don't want to burn bridges. Number 1 is also part time and flexible so it is possible I could do both. I know most people would burnout from that, but I actually enjoy working so it wouldn't be an issue for me so long as the work is interesting. What would you do in my situation? In the long run I would love to work at number 1 so choosing number 2 might seem counter intuitive, but getting the training there would make me so much better at the job I want to do at number 1 in the future. I don't really have anyone in my life to talk to about this stuff so I would love some advice.
ueu11a	1651261908	132	I have a master’s degree in English (BA same) and work in the AEC industry as a marketing and proposal manager. I’m exhibiting several signs of burnout including lack of motivation, lack of focus, fatigue, crying over work stress. I’ve been doing this for almost 14 years with some breaks in between. I make low six figures—does anyone have advice on how I can maintain something close to that salary for now—in a different type of job?? I’ve been trying to go back to my “roots” in editing, but so many of them are temporary/contract and I need something steady for at least two more years. My long term goal is to go into hospice work, possibly as a Buddhist chaplain—but that’s a couple years off until my daughter graduates highschool. Thanks everyone!!
uec235	1651200436	244	i just took a job for $110k that i was bit nervous about work life balance before i even applied for the position. i voiced this to the folks that would be my now current bosses and they assured it me it would well balanced. anyway, two weeks in and i already have been very overwhelmed by the amount of work piled onto this one position. i voiced my frustration and they have agreed to hire an additional person to offset the workload, but the timeline for doing so is not clear yet.i also asked my old boss if i could potentially have my old job back and they said they would love to have me back and the job is still mine if i want it. my old job pays about $80k, so there is a substantial difference in pay. my old job had great work like balance and i am finding that i’m not super interested in the work my new job requires, whereas i was never disinterested in the work of my old job. the new job may be better in getting me a different position down the line, but i am afraid that i will burnout if additional staff are not on-boarded asap, and i already dread doing some of the tasks required. what would you do in this situation? try and stick it out for the increased pay or take the job that is more enjoyable, but pays significantly less?
ue9vvk	1651193699	357	I don’t know if this is the most appropriate subreddit for this topic, if not, please refer to me to relevant ones I’m at that job for almost 1.5 year now, in a new filed to me and so far it has been very rewarding in terms of learnings &amp; skills.However for the last 3 months I noticed that I’m getting anxious and very much tired on a daily basis. The workload reached higher levels (although not working outside of office hours, I’m having way more packed days with back to back meetings / stuff to do) This is due to a change in the staffing process, so now people in my position get staffed in 2 different projects - theoretically half time each - The 2 projects I am staffed take way more than half time each if I want to keep doing things correctly and running it smoothly. and that’s the problem I think I tried to talk to top management about this switch and how it does not serve the quality of the projects outputs (we’re a client facing agency). What they suggested is to look up how I “manage my time” and help me delegate some tasks. Nonetheless, they refuse to agree that this new setup on a project doesn’t allow to do things correctly So everyday I find myself having a never ending list of things, tasks, improvements to take care of and just when I think I’m “done”, I find a new wave of tasks waiting for me and the team. I keep having back to back things to do throughout the weekSo I’m in a sort of predicament. From one side I like the field I’m in and the people I’m working with, from another side I feel that this situation has a taunt on my physical and mental health (a lot of switching context, having to remember stuff, do follow up, thinking about tasks outside of office hours etc...) I feel like I’m in a fine line between loving my job and getting a burnout Have you faced a similar situation ? Do you have any feedback ? Much appreciated
udz49l	1651163658	145	I’m working in a big European bank and had a burnout mid 2021.(after some workplace harassment, bullying, hard breakup, work being highly repetitive and boring)After a month off I was pushed to try to work a little bit again, for 4h a week. There were some fights with the company doctor and relapsing etc, now I’m supposed to work 7h a day and be expected to be fully on track in two months.I wish there is a questionnaire sort of thing that gives me insights on what stage I am now. I tried to do some burnout tests online but the questions are all linked to my current job, but I know from the bottom of my heart that if I change to another job, I can succeed. But just not the current one.Am I getting ahead of myself? Is there a way to know this?
ucgvvn	1650991407	73	I’m looking for a remote job that I won’t fee burnout from right away. I’ve struggled with this is the past couple jobs I’ve had where after a few months I just have no motivation to work there anymore. I’m not sure what industry I want to be in or what kind of role I might find interesting. Looking for suggestions from other remote workers! Bonus points if you lmk how you were hired.
ubq7sy	1650906919	214	i graduated from BU which feels like the only thing i have going for me, professionally at least. i graduated with a BA in Sociology and a BS in film/communications, but no longer want to work in the latter field anymore. classic stuff. The majority of my experience involves management/leadership positions I’ve held at the cafes I worked at through college, along with a few temporary work study office/event coordinator jobs and a PR internship from a few years ago. i’m interested in the nonprofit/ngo sector, neuropsychology, public health, and really anything related to social/environmental justice or immigration. im open to work in video/media/comms in those fields, but feel like i dont have enough relevant experience. i have a small video portfolio and graphic design skills, but not much relevant employment experience. honestly though, at this point i just want a salaried remote job not centered around sales/customer service that will at least pay me a living wage where i don’t have to anxiously check my bank account every other day. working in the service industry, especially during the pandemic, has caused so much burnout.right now it just feels like ive locked myself into the service/hospitality industry and the financial struggles that come with it. if anyone has advice or words of encouragement, hit me.
ubp7bo	1650904267	224	Since I was a kid I have always been interested in healthcare. Ive always had a passion for medicine. I watch the medical dramas, know above average things about it. Hell I was even able to read my own lab test to my PCP and I have no medical experience whatsoever. Now that I am 30 and finally have the funds to go back to school and actually do something in the medical field I am starting to second guess myself. Everything has become so politicized now.People are turning to gov't officials for hc advice instead of their own docs?! With the vax mandate and dr's and nurses both quitting at an alarming rate, I'am not sure if this is the right field for me. .But this is something I have been wanting to do my whole life and it seems like ever since COVID this field has only gotten worse. I am currently working in a warehouse atm and to be quite frank I like it. I like driving forklifts and doing things around the warehouse but this is not something I could see myself doing for the next 5-10yrs. I enjoy hands on work and helping people and problem solving, which is why healthcare appeals to me, but I feel like every other post I see is someone leaving healthcare due to burnout
ubkzxc	1650892775	149	I've been at my company 5 years and I'm about to turn 27. The last 6-12 months I've had increasing anxiety,  something I've never experienced much of before. I'm not overworked, but I'm increasingly demotivated and disengaged. My boss is nice to me but I don't really respect his opinions, and I no longer believe in the company. I'm pretty sure I'm burned out, because I've started to be very irritable/feeling low for no reason, all the time.I've decided I need to get a new job and have now started applying. I'm just a bit worried that maybe the burnout isn't due to my job, then I'll switch job and still be feeling lazy/demotivated. I used to be a really high output worker and high achieving. I'm looking for some stories/advice on people who felt similar, then changed jobs to get their spark back. I'm based in London btw.
ubdmsd	1650864363	379	After about seven years at my former company, I quit in 2021 for more pay and a better work-life balance. The new job was easy and it checked all those boxes I was looking for. However, nothing is ever perfect. I knew pretty quickly I wasn't interested in staying long-term and after learning I was misled in the hiring process, I was motivated to start looking for a new job.Thinking it would take a few months to land another position, I started looking around 7 months in. But to my surprise, I quickly found a great new gig with a better title (in leadership) and an even better salary. At first, it was great, but a few months in things got progressively worse. For context, there was a lot of turnover on the team before I joined and a few months in another wave of significant turnover occurred that disproportionately affected me and my team (I've had to take on another project and lost multiple key team members). My workload has been dramatically increased in the last two months and I dread going into work everyday. The latest few sunday scaries have turned into full-blown panic attacks. I know it's no way to lead a team, who are looking up to me for assurance and confidence. I also have people depending on me to deliver. I can tell my performance is slipping under the stress and burnout. I've expressed my concerns at length but the issues, I anticipate, will last at least for several more months at least.A part of me thinks no job is worth my mental, physical, and emotional health like this. Another part of me is worried I'll tarnish my career if I leave a leadership role within 4 months (a second job I've left under a year). Only a year ago I was at my original company and I feel like I've lived so many lives since then and have made incredible gains in the current job climate that I'll lose what I've worked for if I quit. On the other hand, the burnout and stress I'm experiencing is so severe, I'm equally afraid this house of cards will come crashing down and my reputation will be tarnished in a different way.Any and all thoughts/advice welcome!
ubczii	1650861933	147	After researching the above question I settled on Physician Assistant and have my whole plan set up: participate in clinical medical assistant training this summer, work as medical assistant for next 2 years while taking science pre-requisites at community college, apply to PA school. I’m having second thoughts on moving forward with this since seeing a mass exodus from healthcare due to burnout on these forums. I previously worked as a criminal investigator for several years and became severely burnt out (extremely heavy caseload, logging every 6 minutes of my time, regular secondhand exposure to abhorrent  violence). I want to make $100k or more and not work more than 40 hours a week, and not come home completely exhausted. I do want at least some in person, human interaction &amp; would like to provide a direct, tangible service to people, which is why healthcare appeals to me.
ub22yz	1650827975	192	I listed some pros and cons of both fields, but I am still so undecided. If I could get some input on this I would really appreciate it! OT: PROS1. Great staff/helping people 2. Good pay? 3. Good hours? 4. Science classes (I like)5. Summers off if I work at a school CONS: 1. Burnout helping ppl2. People's health is in your hands 3. Lots of paperwork4. Long work hours? 5. Lots of interactions with people, may be draining. -theres mixed info about OT, some people say good work hours and leave at 4 others say it's longer. LMFT: PROS 1. Like learning about human behavior. (Psychology) 2. Good pay? (Some say 35/hr some say over 40?) 3. Helping people 4. Can work from home5. Can eventually become psych professor? Cons: 1. Can get lonely (work alone when not with clients) 2. Hours? (Some say good morning hours some say you have to work evenings or weekends).3. Unsure about pay? 4. Lots of paperwork (unless in private  practice 5. Can deal with trauma and heavy stuff If you have any experience in these two careers which one do you prefer and why?
ub1aqu	1650825737	152	I have recently relocated to a new site in my company. I work full time and weekends on a 1 in 5 rota. The commute from door to door can be as little as an hour, if the trains and buses align. I take 1 train and 1 bus each way. Whilst the transition has been difficult with a new way of working and new team members, I finally feel settled in. This being said I've only taken 1 full week off since July 5th which was Xmas week. All other times have been odd days due to staff shortages (everyone loves to take a Monday/Friday off).This has led to feeling like I'm always in work and never taking a full mental break to relax. This brings me to my question, should I take a month unpaid leave to mentally and somewhat physically reset?P.S. I could financially cover the months' loss of earnings.
ua7yst	1650727971	146	I have lived in the Midwest working a super micromanaged job which has caused me lots of burnout, anxiety, and overall stress. For the first few months it was all in person and they finally gave us a bit of a remote option which they still micromanage. My supervisor is nice but I’m still looking for a field and location where it will be more flexible for my own mental health. I’ve heard the corporate realm but in a more “liberal” state tends to be more flexible and more like “if you do the work properly and on time we wont hound over you”. I’ve also heard micromanaging to be less in the tech field depending on location. What questions can I ask in an interview to help me avoid entering a very toxic/micromanaged workplace? What can one keep an eye out on during/before interviews? Thank you!
ua4j1j	1650717462	755	I have been working with my current employer (a university) for 15 years and for the most part I am incredibly satisfied with the work I do. However, in recent months, the volume of work has become much greater resulting in some burnout. I was recently approached by the deputy head of my department (3 positions above myself) regarding using my knowledge to develop in-house resources to support the teaching of a new veterinary science degree. This would be a huge amount of extra work and would require that I have some assistance with managing this new workload. In a private discussion with the deputy head, he laid his cards on the table and told me that this additional member of staff would not be managed by myself, but I would be expected to mentor them and they would be working with me on a daily basis. Essentially, as I saw it, they will expect me to take on the role of a manager for this individual, but I would not receive a promotion. Understandably, this got my back up, so I immediately went looking on job websites and found a role that I was a perfect fit for, working at a competitor university's research facility. A newly established building with ripe opportunities for expansion and career progression, a place I'd had my eye on for a couple of years since they started planning the build. Long story short I applied, smashed the interview and I have received an offer. The offer is equivalent to the manager's wage I should be paid if my current employers were being reasonable i.e. a grade up from my current salary. I have asked for time from the potential new employer to consider the offer and would like to use this opportunity to leverage the promotion I deserve from my current employer. I have established myself well in this organisation, I'm well respected by all that know me, I have an excellent rapport with the academic lead for the course I support and a high degree of investment in the teaching environment the pair of us have built together. It's something I would leave behind with a heavy heart but not accepting this offer would almost certainly be a missed opportunity. Hence my aforementioned strategy to essentially have my cake and eat it.The tough decision I'm having with this is how best to implement this strategy. My immediate line manager is very hands-off, a quality I appreciate for the most part. However, I've not had an appraisal in 2 years (supposed to be annual and recently switched to quarterly as of 2022 - still no appraisal). His boss, the technical manager for our department, seems to have a lack of respect for me. I approached him recently after my 6-year-old, employer-provided, laptop started failing. Despite providing a lot of evidence I needed a new one and asking on multiple occasions, he refused to do anything about it. In the end, I went to the head of our entire department, a very supportive and approachable guy who didn't think twice about immediately furnishing me with a new one. To paint the full picture the guy that asked me about the vet school work sits between the technical manager and head of department in the organisational hierarchy. My instinct tells me that if I want to convince my current employers to retain me at a higher salary, the head of department would be the man to approach. The risk I see is that I wouldn't be following the chain of command and this may well anger the individuals who would still be my immediate superiors in my new position, especially if there was any backlash for them not having done their duties such as appraisals etc. I like these people and don't want to throw them under the bus. The head of department almost certainly knows my value and would likely be in the best position to authorise such a salary increase. Aside from my external job offer I have plenty of evidence of the volume of work I have undertaken lately which would almost certainly justify my request. Those I support would also no doubt testify to my immense value to the department. So, how should I do this? Speak to the technical manager that couldn't even provide me with basic resources to do my job, or go straight to the top and approach the head of department? Any other tips and tricks for implementing this strategy would be greatly appreciated.
u9v33z	1650680629	77	I feel like I am not good at core competence, I can't hide it. It is hurting my self-esteem, physical and mental well-being. Feel like quitting but I don't know what else to do as I am doing this for 20years! I get the things accomplished but I have no satisfaction and fun. I feel like I am burned out.  I changed my employer few months ago thinking that may help but it is not helping. Need advise.
u9khth	1650649914	106	Hi all! Long story short, having teacher burnout and is so mentally prepared to leave. But I don’t have another job line up and do not know where to start. Thought about being a manager, but then am nervous because I don’t know what is it like to lead a team full of adults since I have only lead teenagers. So what else is out there? I know it’s not true, but I just feel like I can only be confident being a teacher since that’s what I know I am good at… Does anyone have any advice? Similar experience to share? Anything would be appreciated! Thanks!
u825in	1650476809	448	I've been working from home as a GIS (geographic information systems) Technician for the last 3 months, my job entails manually editing large amounts of data which is very drudging work . On paper this job is pretty good, I don't have to commute to work, the pay is decent, and the company seems to value its employees. However I have found myself extremely burnt out and unable to focus. I am unable to get out of bed to start working, and when I am working I find myself getting distracted very easily due to the mind-numbing nature of the work, I feel it is only a matter of time until my PM realizes my production is much lower than it should be. Before this job I worked as a field tech for an engineering company for 5.5 years, but got burnt out from that job as well due to the long term travel that was required, plus a long commute when not traveling. I thought this remote position would be the answer to my burnout, eliminating both travel and commute, but unfortunately it wasn't.My bachelor's degree is in geography and I'm halfway through a master's in GIS, but I really have no interest in the GIS field. I've only been further pursuing GIS experience to obtain jobs that will get me an acceptable paycheck, which I now realize is near-sighted and will ultimately leave me unhappy. I originally went to school for music education, but changed my major after my freshman year due to the poor job outlook for music teachers. However I still believe I was meant to work with music in some form, it's the only thing that consistently gets me excited.This leads me back to my original point. I'm considering leaving this job and taking 2 months off to try and mentally recover from this rut. I have enough money in savings to get me through 3 months. If push came to shove I have money in retirement savings and I have a good amount of equity in my house, so I could figure something out. During this time I would work on becoming physically and mentally healthier by working out and meditating, and learn about music production and really see if this is something I want to pursue. I have been learning some on the side, I have all of the software/hardware I need, plus guitars, a drum set and microphones, I just haven't had the time or energy to really hunker down and learn.&amp;#x200B;TLDR: I hate my current job/field and want to take a 2-3 month break for my mental health, and to decide on a new career path, likely a music field.

u7wfor	1650461018	125	My wife has been a Music teacher for nearly 20 years. Most experience has been freelance with a specialism in Early Years Music, but has had recent experience as an unqualified classroom teacher.She has had time out of work due to burn out and some unfortunate personal circumstances and now wants some stable work whilst having young kids.She doesn't want to start a business again as she wants to generate a stable income quickly and she doesn't want to go back to classroom teaching as she is only starting to recover from burnout.I'm looking for ideas for alternative jobs either in education (less classroom focused) or other careers with transferable skills, but I don't know where to start, so any suggestions would be really helpful :)

u6lk8f	1650310796	374	So I’m looking for some thoughts on my current situation and how to proceed. Single, 32M with a dog. I currently work in a very high paying job with realistically 3-4 weeks off for vacation. The work itself is painfully boring and mind-numbing. I work in accounting and have muscled my way through this career for TEN YEARS and have never taken more than a week-long vacation. The workload comes in waves, with some days doing absolutely nothing but listen to corporate robots drone on and on about data or accounting and other days shuffling papers for 12 hours. The work is pointless and it has been the entirety of my career no matter what I change (I’ve worked for 3 different companies now).The work is fully remote, however.I believe I’m currently teetering on the edge of full on burnout. I also don’t think this burnout is fully work related because I just had knee surgery, which took away all my hobbies (sports, exercise, etc.) which kept me relatively sane. Also, im looking for a good partner and have had relatively no success going past initial dating stages despite doing tons of self improvement work on myself. As of late, I’ve been using alcohol to numb myself, as well as vacations, movies, friends, and other distractions. Based on the above, I’m having trouble understanding if this is 100% work related or life in general related. I really think my mental health is taking a dive. I’ve noticed it in ways such as irritability, alcohol use, melancholy mood, anxiety, guilt, existentialism, etc. I don’t have much liquid cash available that I could use to take a prolonged unemployment break to travel the world or something. My thoughts on moving forward are as follows:1) stay in job, muscle through the burnout. Use travel and whatnot to stay afloat. I’ve also been thinking of getting an RV and traveling domestically while working remote but I would still be doing the same mind numbing tasks from 9-5. 2) Quit job immediately. Savings are low, could do odd jobs to stay afloat. 3) stay in job for a period of time, save up money to quit and travel the world. 4) Request a 3 month sabbatical in the near future.

u3rk1t	1649970768	599	I'm really hoping to get some advice here as I have reached the end of my rope in terms of work related stress and I need to make plan to change my situation. I am 32 years old and have a Applied Bachelor degree in Supply Chain Management (severely under educated for my position, I work mainly with Engineers, MBA's and Lawyers). I work in Corporate Strategy for a downstream energy company. Specifically I'm the manager of supply strategy and markets. I have worked at this company for 7 years now and recently got promoted to that title and have been the manager to 1 direct report with another one likely coming for about 6 months now. I have no previous managerial experience. My role has a lot of cool things going for it. I get to be involved in high level strategy discussions and brainstorming, I get to create material for board meetings and investor presentations and present on these things, but I also mainly do math. Math, math, math. I hate math. I failed math in high school and had to redo it in summer school in both grade 11 and 12. I got C's in stats in university. The fact that I get paid very well (about $170K CAD) to do math for a living is something I would never imagine. Now I spend my days evaluating business cases for different projects, putting together budgets for the company and am responsible for proving out investments and contracts that are worth tens and sometimes even hundreds of millions of dollars. In this role learned how to think problems through and with the magic of excel and google, I feel like have conquered my math demons at least when it comes to work. In the end most of the math I do is very straightforward and the hard part is making sure you include everything you need to and that everything is perfectly communicated. Thats where I get eaten alive. Not that I make mistakes often but no one really checks my work, they all just nod in agreement and run with it. Unlike most jobs where you get immediate feedback on if the job was done well (Yes I booked a truck, Yes the client is happy with the design, Yes I marked those papers...etc), I never know. Even if things work out it could easily have been just lucky that prices worked out the way they did and covered up a mistake. Now I live in a constant state of fear and stress that I made some mistake that is going to end up blowing up in my face. It routinely keeps me up at night and definitely impacts my health.  So I need a change. However it feels like I've now developed this skill set that is not really applicable to anything else. I would list my skill set as: Able to build complex models in excel, able to create cohesive and professional c-suite level presentations and present them, able to breakdown problems to their component parts and strong data collection and research skills. Is there any fields outside of Corporate Strategy, Business Development and Finance where these skills are rewarded? TL:DR: Currently work in corporate strategy and reaching burnout. Skills include: Able to build complex models in excel, able to create cohesive and professional c-suite level presentations and present them, able to breakdown problems to their component parts and strong data collection and research skills. Low education with just a bachelor degree. Any non-corporate finance related roles or industries where I could leverage this?
u3r2a1	1649969409	280	Hello r/careerguidance, hope all is well! (throwaway just in case) Bit on my situation:I've been working at the same office for the past 3.5 years and I've been looking to leave. I didn't hate it and my coworkers were great. The pay is on the lower end for my area but the benefits are good. However there is no room for me to grow and learn new things. The office will never change and has grown stagnant as a result. Having to wear multiple hats after losing my coworkers has been very stressful as well.Sort of fell into the job as an temp admin assistant at this small office and moved up to my current job as a "benefits specialist" which doesn't really describe my job very well. It's a sort of odd hybrid of AR and HR. I hadn't had any experience nor exposure to either, leaving both my accounting and HR knowledge limited compared to what is asked of a HR generalist or AP/AR clerk. I don't have much of a preference to one over the other. They both have had their advantages and disadvantages. One allows me to just put music on and punch numbers while the other allows me to assist employees and guide them. Not really sure how I should pivot elsewhere with my experience as I feel both underqualified for anything similar yet qualified enough to at least look. My bachelors is completely unrelated as well which hurts me more than it helps I feel (it was Art, which I loved studying but knew I was not cut out for an actual career.) Any advice? I just really want out before burnout hits the fan.
u3hxkn	1649944032	478	I’m hoping I’m in the minority here, but over the last 6 months I’ve become completely detached from any passion I’ve had for mechanical engineering. Every job is the exact same story. I’ve been in industry for 8 years now and all I do is administrative paperwork, tolerance stackups, drawings/models/assemblies, RCCA, and MRB. In between the brief periods of tasks, I’m faced with an endless void of absolutely nothing to do. I’m in my 3rd job, and the story is always the same.Job 1. Small company that only did business the first few months of the year. Every year. After having nothing to do for a solid 9 months after I literally brought my Xbox into work for 3 months (that’s how little oversight i had), I left for job 2.Job 2.Large corporation with very VERY talented out-of-my-league engineers. Surprised I even got hired. Everyone had their projects that I never got the opportunity to touch. The engineers were also super old which meant I was stuck running cad and FEA all day. Then I would have 2-3 months of doing nothing. Repeat. When asking about additional tasks I was just given additional CAD work. Very few opportunities to grow or learn. Also tons of meetings for no reason, like you don’t need a team of 25 people to decide what shade of green to paint an electrical box. Left due to a family illness in another state.Job 3. (Current)Again running cad and filling out administrative work for a high volume manufacturing facility. Again I’m in a lull with no work for the last two months. In a completely silent office since 90% of the staff is WFH. It’s like being in a waiting room for 9 hours a day. Not learning anything, no design, no testing, super old dudes with nobody to relate or talk to, I’ve just had it.Again I must iterate that I’ve asked for additional projects (if there are any), I’ve asked to learn, I’ve shadowed and networked and tried everything to occupy my time with something to better my skills. But alas nothing. The only rewards I’ve reaped are another tired cliche about coffee, office life, “living the dream”, and so on. Literally almost cried on my drive to work today thinking about the buzz of the fluorescent lights, the mouse clicks, and periodic throat clearing or loud sips for the next 9 hours. The only skill I feel like I’ve picked up is software because I’ve had to automate so many of these repetitive tasks.Where do I even begin to fix this? I’ve only been at this recent job for 6 months and I’m already in the same boat as always. No tasks, monotony, unrelatable team, gatekept projects, and meetings. Even when interviewed with this place they inquired about my “job hopping” since I was at my last company for only 3 years.
u2gkwn	1649819098	237	So i am a trade school student in high school and I am learning HVAC. I have been in the program for about 7 months at this point, and I have worked really hard I always ask my teacher for help or ask for more reading material and I study every school night. The work I have put in has paid off I have 2 certifications (which is how many our teacher wanted us to get this year) and I even placed 2nd in our class competition and soon will be moving to state competition. However I can't tell if it's just burnout from all the work I put in or if It's just not what I want to truly do but I am starting to feel disinterested in the trade, when I first started I wasn't sure I wanted to make a career out of it or even like it but I have put in so much work it feels like it would be a waste to just quit. But I want to find a job that I enjoy and for certain I can't say I would hate doing HVAC as a job but I think eventually I would end up hating it if I did it for 20 to 30 years. I am thinking about discussing it with my teacher to see what he says, but I just wanted an outside point of view. Thank you.
u04ar9	1649544482	82	I think I'm experiencing some sort of burnout, but here's the problem: I've never even worked. not really. I'm in my last university semester and I've done some internships here and there. I study Journalism and have absolutely no perspective in getting a job in the communications area. And, idk, it feels like it isn't worth it, like I'm not capable of getting a job, like I can't get anything done because I keep procrastinating. Am I too young and inexperienced for burnout?
tza7pk	1649443079	260	When I started college I was convinced I wanted to be a mental health professional, but as I got more into it I realized the two extra years of school + 3000 internship hours + the licensure examinations after that would just take too long to be making a mediocre living. I also realized that emotional/cognitive burnout is just not worth it. I really fell in love with the science side of psych though and continued my pursuit. I'm graduating with my bachelor's in June and I feel as though a job in the tech field probably suits my personality best. After looking into it, it seems UX makes the most sense considering my psych background. Ideally, I would just go directly into an internship and start my career, but after searching a bit I discovered most require that you at least be enrolled in a grad HCI/UX program or have experience. I have no experience specific to the field or portfolio. Does it make sense to immediately go into a grad program to give me a head start and build up some experience? I got in to DePaul's online Human-Computer interaction M.S. and they have really good stats (94% employment rate and 80k median salary 6 months post-program) and I'm thinking of possibly applying to some other programs too. The price of a master's program isn't really an issue for me (long story). I guess my options are to just teach myself and build a portfolio, go into a master's program, or do a Bootcamp over the summer? Any advice?
tz9r4r	1649441788	47	I currently work in quite a high stress job and am at burnout point. I really want a job which is more relaxing even if it doesn’t pay as well. Is this possible or are recruiters just going to think I am lazy if I tell them this?
tz86mn	1649437408	295	Hello there,I (F, 28) left the hospitality industry in 2020 at the end of a management training program in a foreign country. Having given my 100% and having worked hard and super long extra hours in the food and beverage department, with 3-4 hours of sleep a night, looking back now I almost certainly experienced a burnout. So I have decided to go back to my home country and start my own online business (ecommerce) - and was so excited that I told everyone at work about it as well - including my superiors who wanted me to stay there at the end of my program. Now after 2 years of moving back to my home country - and hating it :D (Eastern Europe), and a business that did not turn out great for various reasons, i find myself feeling lost. I would like to go back to the industry and move to Costa Rica. However, I sort of feel ashamed to reach out to the people who could possibly help me put in a good word for me at the partner properties there. I have also been sending my CV &amp; doing online assessments with no result so far - and that process feels draining to be honest because I know that getting a work visa in CR is a difficult process. All I know is I want to move there and I would do anything in order to get there - it has been my biggest dream for the past 5 years. The plan is to open a business there but I need some source of income until that is up and running. What would you advise me to do? How should I approach them or what should I do?Thanks for reading this.Much love
tz2swi	1649422171	440	I started a job that was a big step up at a very dysfunctional organization a year ago. It was a new role and the culture was bad and sometimes hostile.I was thrown in at the deep end completely unprepared. It was a sink or swim situation.I gave the job my 100%. Everything I didn’t know I literally googled, watched youtube and learned. I built trust and relationships through supporting other people when they needed my help.I’ve slowly gained confidence, leadership skills and the respect of my peers and manager(s). I’ve done things that no one else has done and pioneered initiatives that other teams have since borrowed.But my mental health and personal life suffered a lot from being overworked and burnt out. I’m getting headaches and all kinds of stress induced problems. Sometimes my job requires me to be on call and I can’t relax at all even after my day job is over. My schedule doesn’t allow me to take sick leave sometimes because I have too much too do.There is no additional support for me because the whole organization is understaffed. While I am overworked, I still provided support to other people. Two months ago I started looking. I finally got an offer that pays 17% more and the employer promises better work life balance and support. It also comes with a better title. I know there could be shortcomings with that job down the line because recovering from the burnout is important right now.When I finally told my manager(s) and colleagues about the opportunity I couldn’t stop crying because I felt so bad. I’m still crying now. I’m so grateful for the opportunity to have the autonomy to do great things here. Some of them believed in me before I started believing in myself. Looking back I’ve grown so much as a leader because of all the crap we dealt with together. I was too scared to even open my mouth in leadership meetings in the first months. Now I feel way more confident to speak up and advocate for my own work.I just hate that I’m not more resilient like my colleagues. I wish I could work this hard but not feel burnt out.  I gave my job everything but this way of life isn’t sustainable.My manager offered to take on call duty off but they couldn’t match the pay. There’s also no additional support offered.I have accepted the external role because I know I cant do this for the long run. But deep down I’m still very sad about throwing away everything I’ve accomplished and disappointing those who thought I was the right person.
tz19qt	1649416836	476	In an unique position and was hoping for perspective.I'm in a leadership role at a very small startup (&lt;10 full time people) in the tech / healthcare space.  The co-founders/CEO are part-time, and the rest of us are full time.My role has enabled me with a lot of freedom but also a lot of responsibility, doing essentially everything:  developing new software that we use, running experiments, being technical point person on business discussion, leading partner projects and managing project budgets, hiring and training new employees, down to repairing the equipment we use.  The team I manage/work with day-to-day are exceptional and very talented individuals and also 'wear a lot of hats'.Recently we ran into issues with one of our projects owing to issues largely beyond our control: delays and task failures due to under staffing, having too many urgent things to do concurrently, and equipment failures. I've seemingly taken the brunt of "blame" for it from one of the founders.  This has led to immense stress (working every day of the week, 10-12+ hour days), burnout, and resentment on my end for hard work not being appreciated and the monumental difficulty of the role/tasks we have not being respected. Instead it seems as though I'm put in a position of inevitable failure due to lack of resources and then eventual blame when it doesn't work out. This has also led to tension with the co-founder who is then questioning my decision making and requiring more approval on smaller decisions, which then further jeopardizes the projects because they are not in the day-to-day so they don't really understand the nuances of what we're doing and why and don't always respond as quickly or as often as is needed.On my end, I've realized I was expecting too much and by contributing so much to so many different facets of the company that I'd started deluding myself as to what my position really is.  It's also negatively affected my mental health, and I'm becoming much more negative and cynical.I'm very strongly considering leaving soon, as I'm now feeling like it is a dead end, don't see eye-to-eye with the co-founder, and I'm not nearly as excited about what we do anymore.  But I do not want to burn bridges with the founders and don't want to let my team or our partners down at a very critical time.  It would take months to find a replacement for me as it's very niche and requires different technical skills.Is there someone who has been in this position who has perspective?  Based on this, admittedly one-sided perspective, does this seem normal or abnormal to be in this kind of position?  Would it just be more-or-less the same in a different role? For those who were key-persons and left, how did you do it effectively?
tyt7id	1649384862	162	Hello All, using an anonymous account for reasons.  I've been in IT (network engineer) since 2014.  I have a degree in computer science.  I worked at a financial institution for several years before I decided it was time to move on after what I hit what I thought was the epitome of burnout.  I ended up doing remote work for a software development company but decided sitting completely alone all day was terrible.  Through connections related to my old job, I got a job as an IT Manager.  This job was misrepresented to me.  Long story short, I've been doing that job for 2 months and I feel 10x more burnt out than I did at my old job.  My question is this.  Are there any other real options besides corporate IT and MSPs?  I'm not sure what the right path is anymore, or if IT is even worth it at this point.
typ0dx	1649371749	305	My toxic trait is reading a job description, thinking I’m well qualified for it, submitting the application, envisioning my entire next couple years at the role and what I’ll say in the interview, and then being surprised when I get the classic “unfortunately we will not be moving forward” auto response. For one, do some of these applications even get seen by real people? I’ll load my resume with buzzwords for the ATS and then on a Friday at 2:30pm I’ll have 10 emails in a 15min window with the same auto reply that my application was viewed or won’t be moving forward. I’ve stopped completely reading through job descriptions. I’ll glance at the requirements and hit submit if I fit the bill. I suppose that’s one reason I get so many rejections: I resume spam sometimes. I’ve become iced out to many rejections now and just move on but some still sting. I also use the hybrid mode and do quality tailored applications with cover letters, and most of those are a wash of wasted time. I never even hear back most of the time. I’ve gotten 3 interviews and a job offer in the last couple months. The offer was straight up disrespectful, ranging from unprepared interviewers who stood me up at first and then an insulting $15.75/hr. I have a BA and am getting my MA but I could still have a more engaged interview experience AND make more working at target. It’s just so tiring. I feel impatient and unworthy. My current job is ringing out my motivation like I’m an old rag they’re hanging me out to dry. 4/5 of my coworkers have moved on to higher paying roles and I’m the last one left. I’m so jealous. Anyways, how can I stay motivated and avoid burnout in this process? (US)
tyn6zf	1649366522	551	Hi, thank you for reading this... I'll try to keep it as succinct as possible, but like most people, I \[F23\] am just at a loss for what to do about my career. I left university in 2020, completing a degree in Psychology. I loved my degree and always hoped I'd do something with it. But at that time, I favoured security and independence, so I signed onto a tax consulting job at a Big 4 firm. It didn't work out (incorrect fit, burnout) and I left after just ten months. I joined a psychology-tech startup (well... it's 7 years old) with big, shiny eyes as a member of the product development/research team. In the beginning, I loved it. I felt like I had found my tribe and a mission I could get behind - even with the paycut from my previous Big4 job. Soon, cracks started coming through. I noticed a franticness (typical for startups- I know) and a sense of rhyme without reason decision-making. After 3 months, I got moved to the sales &amp; department team following a tense conversation in which I was essentially told that my initial research contract wouldn't be extended due to company cashflow. I realise and have been told that I was moved to the commercial team to get sales through the door. The sense of franticness intensified. Constant strategy pivoting. Tenseness and passive aggressiveness in the team. Not many/no sales coming through the pipeline. I'm learning a lot, but there's a huge part of me that feels hugely concerned about the direction the company is headed in. No investors are interested and in short, there is a 100k+ monthly recurring revenue target due by July otherwise the door will shut (we are not anywhere near that). It's April now and my mind is deducing that it's probably in my interest to move on. Yet, I don't know if I should have faith and if my doubts are due to fragility and an inability to commit and move through hard times - aka stay and tough it out. Or, cut my losses and move onto a different job. I'm being paid below market rate (even for entry level jobs) and wonder if I should just pursue something that will at least make me more financially comfortable (I've been stressed about money ever since I started this job due to my improper planning and research). However, as alluded to by the above, I'm very insecure about moving on. Mainly because I worry I'll look like a flight-risk (which, frankly, I probably am) and a job-hopper (I mean, 10 and 6 months don't inspire confidence.. do they).I feel I have legitimate reasons to leave... : A CEO's strategy/style that I just can't get behind/fully trust; the obvious cashflow problem; the emergence of a toxic workplace culture; competitors who just do it better; low salary. I suppose I ask, what would you do? I'm open to very brutal/honest feedback because I'm conscious that I need to be exposed to a variety of perspectives to understand how to proceed. Again, thank you so much for reading. **TL;DR** \- Thinking about leaving a (financially constrained) startup 5 months after I joined after having previously left a corporate job after 10 months - should I stick it out? Or, move on?
twxk28	1649172452	387	Last year, I decided to pivot into accounting after longing for a more concrete career path than I had in the past. I started working in a consulting gig that placed me with various clients in different industries. There is one disturbing trend I've noticed throughout this experience. There is vastly more work to be done than there is staff to do it.The good news is that there is A LOT of work in accounting. The bad news is that there is A LOT of work in accounting which may lead to being overworked and other symptoms associated with burnout.Now, one thing I will acknowledge for the sake of transparency is that not all of the clients I'm go to are in the best of shape. They've usually lost a critical staff member or there is some large scale project being rolled out that they need help with. In short, I'm not always walking into the best environments.However...I've worked for about five clients in the past year. Some have been smaller or mid-size orgs, while I have also sat in F500 GL accounting departments. From this experience, I've observed a lot of the accounting teams being short-staffed and stretched extremely thin. During non-busy periods, it's common for people to be putting in 45+ hours per week. During busy periods, that number is extended to 60+ hours per week. There is always far more work to be done than they have staff on-hand. The manager I'm currently supporting is easily putting in 60-70 hours per week, plus weekends.In most cases, accounting is merely an overhead expense. I understand that for-profit organizations are keen on keeping these expenses to a minimum. Yet, I've worked in a variety of different fields and roles outside of accounting throughout my career, and I've never observed the pinch or the squeeze as much as I have in these various accounting functions.For others who have far more experience in this field than I do, what has your experience been? Is it your experience that accounting teams seem to be short-staffed and responsible for far more work than available staff? I'm wondering if it's merely a correlation with the consulting program I'm in due to the clients we work with, or if this is a pervasive issue throughout the field.Curious to read your experiences and perspectives.

twkknv	1649126239	293	30M, I've been at my current job for about 4 years and can pretty much identify when I am burnt out. I was promoted to another position about a year ago and we've dealt with quite a bit of things during the transition such as more members moving into other positions and training new members as well. Throughout all of this, I feel like I've taken on a hybrid role between my old job and the new one. I am constantly involved with tasks attached to the old role, while learning to manage my own duties under the new one. This has caused me great stress and anxiety. More recently, I am having a hard time getting up in the morning, focusing at work and it feels like it takes me three times as long do finish a single task. Almost like I am going in circles and accomplishing nothing. This past year was also the year I decided to take care of myself. I've been hitting the gym, getting dental work done and found a primary Dr for the first time as an adult. Early on when I started with this company, I took on way too many responsibilities and paid for it dearly. I was constantly depressed and skipping lunch to get my work done, followed by eating junk later on. I did not have the energy to workout or do anything other than be home and try to rest. I am no longer willing to take that route, but I really need advice on how I can better deal with my situation. I am taking a 4 day weekend soon, and maybe a week off in the future but I cant take much more after that. Any advice is greatly appreciated!
tw0o4u	1649074880	382	I’m 20something young and I was very proud and excited to have started my career within an industry that I dreamt of. I was Employed as a Marketing Executive at age of 21 for Contract Manufacturing cosmetics company and their sister company a B2B brand wanting to pursue the D2C industry. In review of all things that has happened since the 6months I worked within these companies I realise I should have seen the red flags and ran away prior to even accepting the position. **Looking back at it now I realise that I was personally too  desperate for the work experience -(after a year and a half in lockdown I was getting anxious about not being able to get a job after Uni if I didn’t get work experience asap) so instead of filling reflecting on my decision and whether it was best for me I decided to accept it**Now that I’ve left the toxic work place, I’ve been slowly getting back to my healthy and happy self. I have less panic attacks and less visits to the hospital. My body is recovering from the mental exhaustion and physical strain of the commute. But mentally  I’m scared to go back to the working environment I’m only 22 and I feel like I’m traumatised and scared to go back to employment. I’ve always been entrepreneurial so I have some businesses on the operations, but considering the cost of living is increasing I feel like I need to get a remote corporate job. Currently working part time as a barista and I get paid more than I did as a Marketing Executive within the Beauty industry. My academic background is within Business and Law. So lately I’ve been considering pursuing a career in Law within Tech. After this traumatic experience and pandemic I feel like I’ve completely burnt out and no longer want to go back into marketing. I’ve been taking a month off from working ‘hard - obsessing about money and chasing the corporate ladder’. Just because I don’t want to repeat any bad choices and habits I did within my previous work experience.I’m  too scared to open LinkedIn and I still get messages from my previous employer.  Any career advice and burnout recovery would be great please. 💕💕

tusd89	1648931244	496	Hi All! I’ll try and be as concise as possible. 27/M/NYI currently work as a construction project manager for a private company. I am good at my job, and work extremely hard. The company has enabled me to move through the ranks very quickly and has increased salary accordingly. (45k - 125k in 7 yearsI still feel underpaid and overworked and feel that the only way to get more money here is to take even MORE work on and continue to overwork. I am worried of burnout. To make things worse, we have blackout periods of no vacation in the summer due to very high workload. I am worried this will affect me when I have kids. Current compensation is 125k, health insurance (although they use a shit provider), 401k, and decent vacation (10) days and (5)sick/personalI got a recent  offer from one of my public works clients. It would essentially be an assistant facility director position. I would train under the facility director whom I’ve worked with for years now and like. The current facility director is retiring in 3 years and they want to put someone now in the asst. position that they know would be a no brainer to promote to fill the retirement vacancy. The client literally told me he knows it would be less work than what I do now based on what He has done with me. They want to offer $140k, benefits (don’t know details but public works should have decent benefits no?), vacation (I’ll assume similar but no blackout periods), pension, etc. Also, because of the retirement scenario as mentioned above, he is telling me I am slated for the director role in 3 years which I think is currently paid out at $170k.Here’s what I feel the pros and cons of new job are:Pros:- better pay $15k higher right now and $45k higher in 3 years- better benefits (assumed not confirmed)- vacation similar but no blackout periods- less volatility with the market, change of projects and locations. A proper home base with an office and no longer driving all over NY for construction projects- pension (I hear pensions are good but I have to read up on them to confirm they are better than private 401k or retirement)- opportunity for the director position - less hours put in and less responsibility - better work life balance Cons- director is top position, no advancement past director (I am not overly ambitious so this doesn’t seem huge to me)- more people to manage (i currently manage small teams of 5-8 employees, new role has custodial, maintenance, and grounds crews that equal out to about 100 employees, although I would interface primarily with about 12 on a typical basis (heads of departments)- monthly public meeting attendance required that run until about 10PM- having to learn new systems and procedures from private-&gt; public sectorThat was longer than I thought but there’s a lot to consider. Look forward to your thoughts. Thanks!
tu23wj	1648848641	479	I am seeking for examples in the community for those who have experienced systemic or covert racism in their workplace in order to help me and my past colleagues build our awareness and put together a case for escalation to leadership. TLDR: I’ve had an eye-opening revelation from several colleagues who have since resigned that they were verbally abused or unfairly judged in their performance based on a project outcome despite delivering on their role responsibilities well, this is validated by the clients.Some examples that I can share are as below:1. Colleague A wanted to take credit for colleague B’s assignment in the final deliverable to the client as a presentation, when this was question as to why that person had the entitlement to have ownership in someone else’s work to present, it was met with hostility and unkind words spoken to them. In that call was Colleague C who has a very close working relationship with Colleague A, that person pressured Colleague B to abide by their request and close the case without engaging in any further dialogue. Colleague B is a person of colour.2. Colleague A worked in another project that had gone well over budget and timeline. During a post launch assessment, colleague A slotted himself into high level conversations with senior leadership in getting insights from the client as well as engaged with the project team for retrospective. The project was undersold, Overcommitted in scope and resourcing of talent is unsuitable based on project needs. The biggest impact that can be measured during delivery which caused the project failure - was the development team not being able to deliver consistently over a period of time and subsequently had to put themselves through weekend overtime work. The decision from this assessment was to put a person on that project on a performance plan - this was ultimately given to the colleague who was the only person of colour in the project team which eventuated in my colleagues departure. Both developers and other members were spared from any conversations and were promoted.And yes there were many factors that can be contributed to cause project failures &amp; not intentional to be covered in this post. Ultimately our view is that the group of people that were highly influential in dictating strategic direction &amp; planning, who were also placing the team in an ideal storm of burnout coupled with fear of being laid off for performance issues, were not being held accountable at all for their contribution. The biggest observation now in hindsight is that the types of people that were constantly overresourced, over pressured to deliver it in the short time frame and were blamed for any project health issues were all people of colour. This eventually leads to mental help burn out which then puts them further in the trenches of under performance. This feels like covert racism.
ttgzys	1648783077	396	&amp;#x200B;Hi,I graduated with a degree in math last year, and am 4 classes and a couple hundred PCE (patient care experience) hours away from being ready to apply to PA school this year. I started my job as an ER tech at a hospital (my first real PCE) a few months ago and all that excitement about PA school and healthcare has faded and I'm now getting cold feet. I just can't put my finger on it.I know for a fact that it is not burnout, and its not my work environment (I have great coworkers), I'm new but I don't feel incomptent. I feel like healthcare is like customer service, and in the ER I work at we get the worst of the worst (5150's, drug abuse, etc ). I feel like its healthcare inherently. The PAs I work with just do essentially UTI's and wound care, and not the breadth I was expecting. On the other side I know that I don't have to work in EM nor will I be doing most of the physical labor that I'm currently doing, but still knowing that I'm unsure if I want to do this forever. I think I would be a good PA, I'm just not that excited about it anymore. I wanted to be a PA because I wanted to be in healthcare forever but I didn't think it was possible with the situation I grew up in. Now, with my husband a med student I thouight it was possible and reignited my desire into healtcare again.On the other hand, I've been reasarching a career in software engineering and I feel like I could do well there, it's not too far off from my degree, and I have worked with and enjoyed coding before, but only on a very basic level. On the other hand I'd be starting over again, would have to teach myself from scratch, and I'm worried that this is just grass is greener syndrome. I'd aslo have to commit to a 9-5 lifestyle, which cannot be part time, like I could with being a PA (which is important for me since I want to be a mom sometime).I'm completely split becuase I could do well in both, and excel in both, but I just don't know anymore.Would love some advice or insight. Did anyone feel like this but continued anyways? Thanks.
tscc35	1648663142	313	Hi all - using a separate account from my main for this since many people know my reddit.I’ve been in the game industry for about a few years now and have climbed the ropes. I focus on project management and switched jobs due to lots of crunch and poor management. During my time in between jobs, I did a lot of self reflection and feel like the industry may not be for me.I was once very passionate about games and have enjoyed some aspects of my job, but the culture is overall so awful. It’s always a grind - working 60+ hour weeks, sitting at a desk for 9+ hours a day. When I get off of work, I feel like I have zero energy and don’t even want to play the games that were once so enjoyable to me because I’ve been working on games overall all day. Before games, I was working on getting into nursing school and got a D in one of the pre-reqs and just kinda gave up. I’m thinking about either 1) going back to school and into something medical. I have been looking into physical therapy assistant programs and after, working on the certificate for canine rehabilitation to be able to assist with animals. 2) doing project management for something different, but would the skills Ive learned transfer over well and do I even have enough XP?I’m facing serious burnout from the industry overall. I don’t feel like this industry is very fulfilling for me. I really want to help people (i know games do help some people) or animals (god i love animals so much but cannot be a vet tech). I would like a more hands on role where I can directly help people or feel like I’m doing better for the world, but the thought of a career change is terrifying to me. TIA!
trr4f1	1648592792	728	I work in HR. I've had the job for just over a year. The team is great; the company is not: employees' (mental health) comes second to achieving monetary goals - even though in the long run I'm sure it costs the company money, short term goals seem to matter more to management.I've made a list of reasons to quit and reasons not to. I'd love to hear your advice to help me decide.**QUIT*** Job focus is HR admin work. I shine in HR policy work.* Culture is result oriented. I do better in a people oriented setting. Basically, management isn’t treating people the way I’d like to see them treated.* Because I can, financially speaking.* Because the work gives me stress, while gardening, cooking… relaxed me.* SO is close to a burnout, not because of work but because of household. It would help if I stayed at home. (Big reason!)* As long as the SO keeps working, the pay check + our savings are enough to set up passive income for when (and long before) we retire.* I have ideas for side projects, that - even though they don’t need a lot of time investment - I don’t find the time for at the moment. Any income these projects would generate would be extra.* I’m loosing sleep over work. I wouldn’t loose sleep over our financial situation if I quit.* We can afford me not having any income. We cannot afford my SO to get a burnout and lose that income.* I have less patience with our 3yo after a stressful day (=all of them) at the office.* I feel I’m spread to thin between setting up passive income (it’ll only be passive after the work is put in once), gardening, childcare, managing the household and work.* It’d be easier to plan our lives around school holidays.* I’d see it as the biggest flex to be able to say I ‘retired' at 35.* There isn’t enough coffee in the world to get me energised for my day-to-day work.* SO wouldn't mind at all if I quit.**NOT QUIT*** I have 2 halftime job offers lined up, but nothing is concrete. I'm not even sure I'd take the offers, but I could at least stay until I get more feedback.* I like my direct colleague.* We’ll be able to live off our passive income sooner if I keep working.* Workload is high right now. If I leave, my colleagues will have even more on their plate.* I’ve only worked here for just over a year. I could give it more time.* 'No, I don’t have something with higher pay lined up, but I’m doing this for mental health reasons and I’m banking on passive income for my pension’ doesn’t feel like a good enough excuse.* It’s scary to take the plunge to quit a steady pay check to stay at home, build passive income and run the odd side project (even though I ran the calcs (conservatively) several times).* I don’t think my mom would approve of me not have a steady income and that she’d worry about my pension.* I think my boss would take it personally if I’d quit without at least something that pays more lined up.* Quitting is awkward.* I feel like an imposter now because my skill set doesn't fit the job. I’d feel like an even bigger imposter if I’d have to pass over tasks to other people and it would truly become apparent I’m no good at the job.* Holding down a job is what’s expected. Throwing everything away to chase passive income is not something people do.* In the unlikely event the housing market completely inflates (and with it the source of our passive income), we’d still make enough to make ends meet thanks to the SO's income, but *my* retirement pay is pretty screwed.* If we'd ever divorce (nothing points in that direction), my SO still has a career. I’d have to start from scratch.EDIT: Having written all this down was a great exercise. Looking over the reasons again helped me realise there are some non-reasons on both sides, there are the same amount of practical reasons to stay as there are to leave, but - most interesting - there are **a lot** more personal reasons to quit and **a lot** more reasons to do with other peoples' expectations to stay.
tqn0n6	1648512405	187	Hi everyone,I have worked in IT for about 2 years and my previous experiences have also been in IT and client-facing.I majored in Math during my undergrad and have recently got into a master's program for analytics and machine learning. I thought the program would add and be a specialty in my technical toolkit but I wouldn't consider myself being actually passionate about the subject. One thing I do know is that I want to apply my skills in the aviation industry (OEM, MRO, airlines, eVTOLs etc.); I love all things that can take flight.I also feel like getting the degree will give me the confidence along with the qualifications. I have tried applying to jobs with burnout and low self-esteem and it's definitely not a good combo when you're trying to network your way into a new industry and the different positions you have little experience with.I guess my question is am I going to grad school for the wrong reasons? I am a bit nervous because it is an investment. I have saved some to pay for the program, and am looking into fellowships as well.Thanks!
tqc5op	1648482148	236	My husband (30, located in Indiana, US) has been doing IT related work since he was in highschool. He is currently the director of IT for a small company, and has been there 3 years. Before he worked for the city that we lived in as a Network Engineer and that is when he started to feel burned out - that placed shaved him down to the nubs. The change to his current position was great for awhile - definitely less stress. But now it's starting to build up again. He has been wanting to learn a trade but doesn't even know where to begin. He feels like he doesn't have time to learn/train for a trade job (his current position keeps has a very high work load) and doesn't know really where to start.  Does anyone have any advice at all on where he can start to transition to a new career? He's been kind of interested in project management for construction. He's a very handy man - knows the basics of building, saudering, and wiring various things. We have been going to therapy since January - our therapist has been trying to get him to set boundaries at work (not working during lunch, deligating more tasks to his team, etc) to try to elevate some of the stress but hes really just tired of the industry.Thank you so much for any advice &amp; suggestions!

to3p8s	1648246874	909	So I'm a 23 year old. 1.5 years college, 29ACT, honor society in school.So I guess I'll have to give a little bit of background because I want you guys to be as informed of my situation as you should. I went to school for 1.5 years with the intention on studying into law. I'm strong in logic and English skills and just always thought it would be a good fit. Anywho, I was also going to school to play baseball. However I tore my elbow my senior season, requiring the infamous Tommy John surgery, UCL reconstruction. This through a wrench into my plan, as I didn't recover the way I should. I ended up taking a gap year and pursue rehab further. I ended up getting offered a new scholarship, but ultimately decided to stay working as a manager at a local restaurant which at the time, as a 19 year old, I made 35k which I thought was good. Things ended up not working with the restaurant and ultimately closed doors due to COVID. At this point I got a job as a residential plumber. I had building trades from high school and thought I could do it for awhile. I did for about two years but wasn't happy with the pay level increase so I was looking for more. I got a Property and casualty license. I thought insurance sales may be a good fit and a good way to get into the finance industry, if I went this root I would ultimately go back to school and get a bachelors in finance or accounting. Both of which I think I can excel at.Here is where my dilemma lies........Before getting a job in insurance I got offered a job in the local Steamfitters and plumbers union. Good package through and through. Journeyman make 40 an hr, with another 22 in untaxed benefits such as pension and health care with HSA. Everything is good....financially and would support me and my soon to be family, have a baby due in October. I just hate the work. I prefer residential plumbing by far over commercial and industrial. More personal value to me, on top of physically light work. On top of the sheer amount of different piping, hangars, etc. Pretty much everything is different, and harder, more dangerous both because of heights, weight of tools and supplies, burning, electrocution. My future baby has made me put into context just how dangerous my job can be vs before I overlooked it. I'm kind of set on leaving, I'm not happy at all I feel overwhelmed all the time, and stressed, no one really teaches me as I get sent out alone almost all of the time. That was one thing I thought would be better in the union, better training both in school and at work, more organization, less hacky stuff and more professionalism. This just isn't the case. I'm falling behind due to not being taught anything. I have 90s in my classes, however they want to keep me as a second year because I'm not learning the HVAC things as quick as they expect. So here's the options.I make 21 an hr on the paycheck. Pension paid on top of that and healthcare provides completely. Overall about 45k a year with overtime. Other pros are HVAC and plumbing license, for entrepreneurial endeavors in the future. As I would like to go into real estate.Cons would be I hate it, I don't feel I excel or have support, dangerous.Option B is a residential service shop paying 26 an hr with bonus and spiffs. More ot. 2nd year techs average about 65-70k a year. No pension 401k match at 4%, would have to pay about 500 a month for healthcare on top. Cons would be I have to spend more time physically at work, 40 vs 50 and I would have to do a paid plumbing apprenticeship after work for 4 hours, one day a week. And I would have to pay for the health insurance. I also am not sure if I want to stay in the trade in general. Experienced burnout in construction, and then doing service in the union, and though I think I would like residential service more, the trade in general may not be a good fit for me for a career.Option C would be to pursue a career in the finance, banking, insurance industries. My first step would probably be insurance sales, while a pursue a bachelors degree, for free that is, and then pursuing Financial advisory, analysis, or management positions. I think I would be better utilizing my talents, I would be taking advantage of the free Tuition I have, less risk of injury obviously, more energy in general which is important with my soon to arrive baby. My only hang backs are making enough money, really need to be at about 50k a year to start but can make 40k a year work. And of course not fitting the role but I won't know that until I try. I don't want to ruin my very good career with the union, but it's just not a good fit it seems. Have hang backs on continuing plumbing as I question the field in general for a long term career for myself. Both in the union and the residential shop. But then I also feel nervous about changing careers in general. What do you guys think?
tnmipo	1648216690	593	29F at a crossroads. I worked in arch/design for the last seven years and got completely burned out. Recently got a "design assistant" job that paid 20k more than my stressful designer/PM hellscape combo and absolutely dove in. During the interview I was told it was an "interior coordinator" position with the intention of training &amp; eventually management. Yeahhh that's not what it is. I get paid 65k a year to open mail, order samples, and essentially be a personal assistant to three interior designers. Best work life balance I've ever had (although ironically I'm struggling with structuring my free time because I haven't had any in a decade). It's frustrating, being almost 30 and in an assistants role with no end in sight. And the people I work for are a tad insane. They also don't communicate well and I'm pretty certain one is a narcissist. But, they also have an aversion to work, which means I get a ton of free time. It takes them roughly a month to review any work I do, and while I am constantly being assigned their "overflow" tasks the job isn't difficult to balance in the slightest. If I ever could move up to management it'd be a breeze. A recruiter contacted me a month ago and I've gone through two interviews with an international accounting firm. I have PM experience and they want me for a new role they've invented, it sounds like my job would be to work with the c-suite and top salespeople to create graphics, data visualization, and presentations to help them communicate better. 10k more with far more mobility and remote WFH, I would be the first person in this role and would potentially be heading up the "design support" department if it went well. My third &amp; final interview is scheduled and my head is spinning, I didn't think I'd get this far. I pursued it because I thought the job was interesting and I could always use interview practice. But now it seems like I may actually get an offer. What do y'all think? I don't know what to do. I feel sick at the thought of passing on such an interesting opportunity, and because I have a design background I fear I'll never get a shot like this again. But I've also been worked to the point of breaking at my last job, and it feels like I'm still recovering from burnout. I'm struggling to manage my depression and forcing myself to do "fun" things to try and find some joy again. Getting myself up and out takes an embarrassing amount of time. I'm tired of being a personal lackey for three women who are disorganized, manipulative, and a little off their rockers. The chance to get a new job, in a new industry, and have actual career growth is incredibly tempting. Love the idea of working from home full time and more money never hurts. But I also feel like I only have the one brain cell left, I don't trust myself to perform at that level again. I'm scared of getting burned out &amp; taken advantage of. I like having the time to pursue therapy, go on walks, cook, and keep my house running. What would you do in my shoes?TLDR; would you rather stay at a comfortable admin/assistant job that paid fine and had work/life balance (but the people you support are emotionally draining) or pursue a gamble that could launch a whole new career (said career would be supporting c-suite execs and top salespeople).
tn1o0c	1648153093	160	Hi everyone, i am hoping to ask for some advise/ideas for possible career choices.I am currently a third year university student (UK) in an allied health proffesion degree and will soon be graduating. However, I have recently been diagnosed with autism and during the course I have come to realise that a patient facing role would be very difficult for me long term.i hope to finish this degree and utilise the qualification, but im currently looking for alternative career choices once I graduate, whether this is a postgraduate degree in a different field (if thats possible), an entry level job, or some sort of graduate training programme. ideally i would want something with flexible hours and minimal socialising alongside outcome based work i.e. my performance is measured by my outcomes, not by working a specific shift pattern. though i am unsure if any of this is possible.if anybody has any ideas then i would greatly appreciate it. thank you in advance.
tkyv56	1648052352	205	Should I stick with it a bit? Go the Sysadmin route? Get into programming? Any other roles I should look into?I'm pretty lost career wise to be honest. I have a four year degree in Business Admin/Marketing, and honestly I hated everything about marketing once I got working in the field. Landed a job at this particular help desk cause they were impressed with some of my raspberry pi projects, and have been doing well troubleshooting stuff over the phone since. However, this doesn't feel like a career path, and I don't really see any upward movement anytime soon. Pay is okay, but not comfortable at all, especially these days. Plus burnout is hitting pretty hard. We've been back to back calls for months due to being understaffed. So I'm really looking for new employment, especially something I can advance my career in IT with. For what it's worth, the company I work with is a government contracted company. None of my supervisors know what GS level of clearance I have, so it's not super helpful. Thanks for any help. It's an understatement to say I'm completely lost as to what to do with myself these days, so any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!
tkvu54	1648047556	437	Hello. I'm dealing with what I think is burnout at work right now. Like most places, we have a worker "shortage" and it feels like my department has been unraveling over the past two years as good people have left and few replacements have been put in. I used to enjoy the small company I work at, and couldn't really imagine why I'd leave - good people, decent salary, low stress. The low stress is the most important part to me. I'm in a slightly unique position in that I'm trying to move into a different role. I talked to my manager about not enjoying Role A and exactly what I needed to change to be in a position that felt good again. The company wants to (eventually!) move me into a new department and train me up. Sounds great, except the timeline.For Role B, I need specific training on the job, and I'm guessing it'll be a couple years until I feel confident in it. My official title was already changed to Role B at work, and they want to work with me to train me and keep me at the company since Role A got too stressful and wasn't a good fit once I'd moved up the ladder. Moving back down the ladder within Role A isn't an option since it would be a very large pay cut. Basically, the idea is that I'm making a lateral move from Role A to Role B and I know Role B would be more manageable but still the same salary and still have opportunities for growth. It would be very difficult to land Role B at another company, since I know very little of the skills required to do the job. I could easily land another Role A at another company but I cannot keep doing Role A. I'm so burned out because despite my title change, I'm still working Role A. They can't get a replacement in for me. They expect it may be a year before they do, and the department desperately needs other replacements as well. What do I do? They REALLY don't want to lose me so is the best approach to just check out and wait it out until I'm actually working Role B? I negotiated a couple different raises last year but feel like I've probably gotten as much there as I can.I can't concentrate anymore, I'm stressed. Both roles are fully remote. I don't know if any of this makes sense but I guess I'm wondering if being a bad worker can ever be a legitimate coping strategy? I feel stuck.

tjilas	1647887620	428	Hi all. I’m recently 20 and have decided that since my parents are paying for my college I should go. My only concern is my ADD, and my passed lack of desire to succeed in high school math. Out of college I want to work in advertising/marketing, media communications or content/grant writing, copywriting or something along the lines of these fields. I always greatly excelled in English in high school so I initially was thinking about choosing that as my major. However seeing as my plan is to, upon finishing school, find a job either near home or remote and work for a few years in order to buy a small home with cash, the employability factor is a concern of mine. While I suppose I could work in those areas with an English degree, I feel as if it would be harder to find a job, and when I did it wouldn’t pay as much as if I studied marketing. Marketing isn’t a program I’d just be settling on either. I’ve always been interested in the workings of businesses from a marketing strategy standpoint. So in turn I’m leaning toward studying marketing for the job prospects and employability despite enjoying English as a subject.That being said I’m afraid of at some point reaching a point of burnout and stress due to difficult math classes (accounting, Econ, calc) that may cause me to dropout or want to change my major. I want to be committed to my major and finishing school when I go, so this would be the last thing I’d want to happen. In high school, my main issue in math was that I did not apply myself or *want* to learn the material. I’m assuming that if I did, I would’ve faired much better. But still, I was in smaller classes due to my lack of motivation and my ADD. The curriculum was more or less the standard, just in smaller classes. When I go to college, I’ll be starting at a cc and transferring to a 4 year. Would someone like myself be able to succeed and not get absolutely burnt out or overwhelmed by studying something with a reasonable amount of math involved if I committed myself to it and kept my plan and goals in mind? Has anyone had experience in a similar situation as me and been able to do well in a business program in college? Would it be worth it or would english/something else that’s not too wildly math intensive be a better bet? Recommendations for other degrees are welcome.
tgqas2	1647568347	367	Hi. So, I don't know what to do in life. Let me put myself in context first.I'm a Civil Engineer, for about 4 years now, here in Brazil. By the time I graduated, I neither liked or disliked it. I went for a job that a friend got me into, right after college. It was for a Industrial Engineer position. It lasted 10 months, with a 11 hour workday, with Sunday as day off. I saved the company a ton of money in projects (they would outsourced it). I left because they were paying me way less than average for my job, and were 5 months due. I've never seen that money. After that, I took a month to do nothing, and the following years fighting for another career, because I was burnt out. I even started studying for a government carrear, but the odds of success are against me.I'm also a Certified Computer Technician and I'm currently enrolled in an Accountancy Graduation, just because I needed a professional of these fields and none that I could afford were good enough, really.Given this scenario, what should I do? I don't have enough work experience in any of these fields, and I don't want to work with building projects anymore. I'm too qualified for them to accept me in an entry job (??), and I can't get any other either. Besides, I have to consider that any job would cause a permanent record for the next employee to see (Brazilian rules). And internships are not allowed outside graduation.I thought about opening a business but I can't see any good enough. Construction is very limited, clients hard to get, and a starting capital way beyond what I have; and I don't want this field anymore. As for computer technician, the market is terrible, if not for something really specific.I'm currently working with a gig, and I make just enough to go on.Given my curriculum, the relatively small city I live in, the Engineer career burnout, what do you think I should do for a better future? Better yet, what do I do with what I have, so I can use then somehow, but follow another path? I appreciate your consideration.
tgkq6z	1647552275	231	I left my job last year due to a toxic work environment, awful boss which caused burnout and mental health issues. I took 3 months off and traveled and relaxed. I’ve been interviewing with mild success the past few weeks and now have to make a decision between this- Company A - big, well known company. Great benefits. Title is meh but don’t care much. Lower base pay but there is a sign on bonus. Work should be pretty chill, not too crazy. Normal hours of 9-5 or 10-6 unless it’s crunch time. I have the offer and signed it already and starting in 2 weeks. Company B - I don’t have the offer but interviewing here - but this is also a huge company, like a giant in the tech industry. Pay is 25% better than company A, benefits probably similiar. Not sure about workload but maybe little more stress than company A. Hours are west coast time so I’d be working 12PM-8 PM my time which is a huge negative for me because it kinda ruins my whole day. The selling point is this company is huge in IT and the title would be great for my career path. Should I keep interviewing at company B and choose it if I get an offer? Should I just forget company B and stick with company A? Any help is appreciated. Thanks
tghc6b	1647543081	112	I work in an international organisation where some people who are close to bosses grow amazingly while others don't. I have worked here for a about 5 years and I know skills aren't the reason for the same. I want to grow in this organisation and learn the skills that make people grow in their lives and careers because  there's no alternative to networking in professional world.I have worked hard and facing burnout issues as well. I am working to get out of it but I really want to achieve newer heights, work on challenging projects. I also want that my bosses respect me and feel that I am a dependable person.
tgfziy	1647539564	97	I know that there’s tons of articles online and can probably get 100 results with a simple google search, but I’m curious to know what you all have done to combat burnout and what you think has actually helped. I’m in my early 20s and I’ve been working my corporate job for 2 years and Im already exhausted. I don’t hate my job and I don’t mind working, but I also just feel extremely unfulfilled. I think most of it has to do with burn out so trying to find ways to fix that before it get worse.
tgf96n	1647537524	161	I recently left an intense &amp; toxic work environment in finance (working on sustainability too how ironic). I left without a job lined up as I was extremely burnt out. Had one interview in Feb and it was for another sustainability role that was recommended to me. I thought I did pretty well and they seemed interested to hire me but in the end I rejected any further discussion due to serious burnout (I had no motivation to do anything, let alone another job).I like finance/investing in general, and was working toward a CFA up till COVID. I thought to start my own little newsletter in Feb too, but gained little traction so far with subscriber numbers. In the meantime I am struggling to create content and I seem to have lost all enjoyment with this + the added stress of knowing that I don't have an active income any longer.What would you do in my situation? Any advice is truly appreciated.
tg8zmo	1647519826	469	Hi, I'm 25M and I'm currently working for a large bank in the UK as a business manager. My job essentially revolves around being a support to the senior management team for a department, along with the analysts in it, even though they aren't technically my boss nor within my team. For context, I've been in this role for just around 2 years.About a year ago, there was a huge change in the management structure of the senior team I was supporting, and as I result, my workload dramatically increased. It didn't help that my immediate manager went on maternity leave at the same time, so I had to begin shouldering most of the work she had previously done. I did receive some support when she had left, but the support herself has also just gone on maternity leave, leaving me alone with an intern to do all the work.At the moment I'm just extremely worn out by the amount of responsibility and work on my plate at the moment. My mental health has significantly worsened, and I feel like I have this brain fog all the time. I used to even work out every morning, but I've stopped because I just feel so tired from work now. I'm being asked to make decisions that I'm in no way ready to make, and while I did manage to receive a promotion, it feels forced rather than something I've earnt.I'm kind of at an impasse at the moment I guess. I genuinely do like the team I work with, and my manager will be coming back from her maternity leave very soon. But even then, I feel like the workload will never subside, and my manager will be coming back part-time initially due to personal issues. I'm questioning if there is even a point to me going to work now because I just end up sitting at my dazed for the entire day, completing 1 or 2 tasks before just heading home. I've tried taking a few breaks but I feel like I end up just working on most days because there really isn't anyone to take my place whenever an issue comes up, and I don't want to leave the intern on our team alone to deal with all these issues. I've started looking at other jobs as well, but I'm definitely despairing at going through another job search, especially since I'll need to request another visa sponsorship to continue working in the UK, while working in my home country will be unlikely as I'm not fluent in the language spoken there.I don't really know what else there is to say I guess. I'm just extremely burnt out and I just feel like I'm waiting to get fired at this point. Anyone has tips dealing with burnout/advice in my situation?
tg73rk	1647512899	103	I have been feeling really tired and unmotivated to work. I used to put in long hours like 9am to midnight for my work. Doing overtime is common due to the nature of the industry and role. Now I am not motivated to work the long hours in the new role but I am also not able to catch up with backlogs appearing. Backlogs are not at critical stage yet, but I'm wonder if I'm burnout or simply trying to have a better work life balance in the new environment or just getting lazy. Any opinion on how I can find my drive again?
tfu5h3	1647467477	279	Hello, I am in a fortunate place, have zero debt (no outstanding loans, no credit card debt) coming out of undergrad but with the goal of attending a top law school three to five years from now. I am trying to see what would be the best job for me, and need some insight.Job #1:Incredibly prestigious in the highest cost of living area in America, making $79,000 with opportunities for advancement and to go abroad. Will help me with future employment, and networking but job has high burn out. Passionate about the day to day work, but won't be able to save much money. Feels like once and a lifetime opportunity.Job #2:Typical data analyst job for a small start-up company in a smaller American city, looking at Excel all day pretty much, making $55,000. Could not live at home.Job #3 :Government agency job where I could essentially sit at home with my parents all day and make $25 an hour with great benefits. The people seem really nice and cheery. 100% remote work and easily what I would consider fun tasks. I have decent relationship with my parents but they live in the middle of nowhere, so not ideal for a young adult.Job #4:Debt collecting job in small American city, salary at $60,000 with opportunities for commission/bonuses. Could not live at home, and debt collecting can be draining.Job #5:Lobbying and performance auditing job in Washington DC at $60,000. No opportunities for advancement but able to network with politicians, good job security, low burnout but also low pay for area. Could not save money.Job #6:No offer yet, but a Virginia non-prestigious but global consulting firm, would probably pay around $63,000.Any suggestions?
tfmh3i	1647449397	104	Hello everyone. I’m a 23 year old female and currently work as a tax associate. I’ve been in this position for a little over two years and I am looking to possibly change. I don’t mind the work I am doing, but I’m experiencing burnout. I was wondering if anyone had any ideas for a career switch or if that’s the direction I should go. I was thinking of trying to make a switch to actuary but I don’t really know if that’s the right move/not sure if I would need to go back and get a second degree. Any help or guidance is appreciated.
teufxq	1647365320	213	So I just moved from South Florida to NYC for a new job. I felt and still feel super underqualified for this job and I'm on a fake it til you make it mentality right now. I've only been here 4 weeks and the real test for me will happen next week when a big project is due but I digress. I am having a lot of negative feelings about my situation right now. First of all, I am anxious that I'm going to mess this up, I am sooo SOOOO exhausted and overwhelmed that I find myself falling asleep on my lunch breaks. I hate my new apartment, it is super noisy compared to where I use to live and the smells, oh that NYC smell. I miss home. I miss the quiet, the weather, the calm, my family and friends. I feel like I made a big mistake coming here and now I'm kinda stuck as I am expected to be in this position for a minimum of 5 years (this isn't a contractual obligation, but it would be career suicide if I didn't stay at least that long). I guess I just want to know if I am simply feeling this way because it's new and if this will get better.
tepiza	1647352450	102	I’m quitting today. It’s been a long time coming, and the reason is chronic burnout (not only related to my job but also the pandemic). The thing I’m struggling with is what to say? I’m taking some time to focus on myself and work on other projects?It’s a bit touchy because it’s a small company, someone quit a few months ago for similar reasons, and the environment is friendly. Not sure how honest to be - do I say it’s burnout? I don’t think it would ruin my professional relationship to say so but. Just not sure how to put it into words.
tempqz	1647343286	356	Hello all. My work environment is an office. I work on a junior team in a competitive salaried niche field. I have been screamed at and 5 people on my team left in one month. We went without a manager for 6 months. People are leaving left and right on other teams. The manager’s manager quit on the spot the the other week and left a manifesto recommending the executives get therapy. I got into a tense argument over Slack today and feel like I’m past burnout. I feel anxious and paranoid on my team. There are cliques and I never fully learned my role. I feel alone and afraid. I have about a month’s expenses and several interviews lined up. I can Uber and rely on credit cards if I really have to for about two, maybe three months. I’m thinking of finding lesser paying contract work. I reached a breaking point today where I stood up to disrespect on Slack and sent a screenshot to HR. I’m too stressed to do my work and I’m losing my insurance anyway soon. I have been holding on for financial reasons. I have unintentionally been driving my significant other away by talking about work constantly. I fear for my professional standing, self-respect, mental health, and relationship. I have felt like life isn’t worth living at times, not because I want to end things, but because I feel trapped. I have a car lease, cell phone bill, insurance, rent, and groceries to cover. I’m fairly certain I can at least get combination of part time jobs at minimum. I would like to just give the Slack situation time and put in my two weeks ASAP. Please, please give me advice. I have a year and several months in this entry level role out of college. Plenty of people leave sooner for less, I just feel beaten down. I have no self esteem, I don’t know what I’m doing, and I’m uncomfortable around my team. There have been public accusations against the management of them bullying us behind the scenes. It feels like a living nightmare with a nice salary.
tek726	1647332707	476	Hello everyone,this might be a vent, but I don't know to whom I could speak and therefore I wish to know what you all think about my situation.&amp;#x200B;I (34M) recently (roughly 4 months) changed job and got a position as a quality manager in a factory part of a big corporation. Previously I've been working in supplier quality for a big and prestigious company in my country (not USA, EU). I was overworked and overstressed there and my work/life balance was completely... well, unbalanced. I was starting to develop stress related afflictions and my mental health was on the brink of collapse. This, combined to the fact I wanted to get back closer to my family and friends, brought me to quit and I found this position closer to my hometown. Plus, a mangerial position was appealing to me. Now the fact is... after just so few time I feel again depressed and miserable. During the hiring process I was told I would have been supported (coached and trained) to become a good manager as soon as possible. This, unfortunately didn't happen at all. Moreover, the overall situation of my team and related processes and way of working is completely terrible. (QM has been lacking for roughly 2 years).I am trying my best to improve the situation but, since there's an extreme firefighting here, overarching projects are really difficult to follow-up and implement. Resistance to change is strong and all the other managers (at least the first line which I am part of) are much older.In general, since this is my first experience managing, the lack of support and feedback makes me feel I am in front of a challenge bigger than myself. Probably I do suffer from impostor syndrome but I can't shake from myself the feeling I am not good enough and that I made a mistake accepting this position.I've always worked in quality after my academic journey (Bachelor, Master in Engineering + PhD) and I feel also here I made a mistake. It wasn't really my passion but since I needed money to support my family I never stopped to think what I would really like to do with my work life. And if you ask the same question now, I wouldn't know what to answer. All of the above combined makes me think about what I could do. Change again? I don't know if this would help. Pivot career? Is this really feasible? What pivot could I make realistically speaking?&amp;#x200B;Any suggestion is very well received guys... I feel quite bad and every day I know it will be just stress and unsatisfaction until the next day. Rinse and repeat until the weekend.Thank you all for consideration.&amp;#x200B;TL;DR - Despite a successful career in my field I feel depressed and unsatisfied constantly. I wish to make a change but I don't know where to start.
te7xt4	1647292293	157	Long story short, I work at a Union factory that pays well, but unfortunately we're here 7 days a week. The pay will be up to 29 an hour in the future. I tolerated it at first, but overtime, I started to hate it more and more with the hours we were doing. Sometimes we do 7 12's also, if we're that busy.I'm 26 years old with no kid's. The only debt I have is a Mortage and that's it. I've been thinking about this for awhile when I had a severe mental breakdown/burnout back in January. Took medical leave for two weeks that month. Now since I've been back, I've been doing my best to tolerate this place. I'm building up my emergency fund as of right now. If you were in my shoes would you tough it out, or would you just build a bulky emergency fund and look elsewhere, so you can look after yourself?
te62qe	1647287364	50	I am currently in college still trying to get my basics done, and I am already having really bad burnout, I think I may be slowly coming out of it, but does anybody have any suggestions to prevent this from happening, and to get out of it if it happens again?
te19zb	1647274862	149	So I am currently going for an architectural engineering bachelors degree, however the more I think about it the less enjoyable it seems. Because of those thoughts, I have been in a sort of burnout limbo, where I don’t really want to do any thing pertaining to college. Recently I have rediscovered, a passion that I forgot I had, which was learning about and observing animals, after I made a bio active vivarium, for a Madagascar giant day gecko. This really got be thinking, that I have subconsciously dreaming of going out into the field and studying, animals in their natural habits, which led me to do research on a zoology or wildlife biology degree. It should also be noted that after college I may be moving to Florida, as it has pay rates for pretty much every job is better than Oklahoma, so any advice would be much appreciated?
tdzyll	1647271415	633	I am struggling lately at work and having a hard time figuring out if this is just me or if I really am about to burn out. I am relatively new to my position (moved over to this department in September 2021) but I actually like the job and my team. I feel confident in my abilities and have been given more responsibilities quickly as they feel confident in me as well. However, since I am the newest on the team I feel the pressure to prove myself and essentially, overwork. I am the only salaried team member on my team so I do not get overtime like they do when they work extra hours. Also, we are all WFH if that makes a difference. I wake up earlier than necessary everyday because there is truly not enough time in the day for me to get everything done. Most days I do not even take a lunch or a break and if I do, we are allowed just one hour. I know that’s the norm and I am not complaining about my hour lunch break - this is more than enough time to eat lunch. However, I basically stopped going to therapy because I do not have time. I am very aware therapy is more important than lunch, but with my hours, my “lunch” is the ONLY time I can get things done if needed during the day- errands, walking my dog, other appointments, etc. On top of all this, 3 out of 5 days of the week are FULL of meetings. This is about 5 or 6 meetings a day which takes a huge chunk out of my actual working time. Because of this, I have been logging back on at night to get things done. Most of my duties have a quick turn around time, so on days with 5 meetings I kind of have no choice but to work at night to meet deadlines. I am starting to feel myself getting burnt out, unmotivated, depressed and so so anxious. I have always been good at time management and being efficient, but how can I set important boundaries without looking like I do not want/can’t handle the work? Everyone else on my team is also in the many meetings but I have never felt they agree about it being too much, making it harder for me to keep speaking up. Maybe it’s because they have overtime. I am meant to do my work, join all meetings, and also assist my team members and those who trained me since I am “new”. I am not looking for special treatment at all. I have mentioned to my manager that the meetings are overwhelming but there has been no changes or understanding on her side, because the meetings keep piling on. I suppose we are maybe a skeleton crew right now, but my manager said she doesn’t have any green lights for more hires on our team. I know this probably isn’t as complicated as I am making it, and that I shouldn’t destroy myself for a job. I have always been more than willing to be open about mental health to my employers, but when I have hinted at this to my manager it was not received in a way that made me feel comfortable talking about these issues. And again, what could I even propose without looking unwilling to carry my weight? Extra break time that my team members don’t seem to need or want? If I do not do my work, or get to it on time, it falls on my teams’ lap and I would never want that. I guess I’m hoping someone here can snap me out of my guilt trips of not working hard enough or being enough. 🙏🏼

tcskr6	1647124288	164	22 yo college grad. Been looking for a new opportunity. My education fits consulting/management consulting quite well: top 10 university, Engineering school half the students in my major went into analyst roles, Double major with econ, also did a business certificate geared toward management consulting. I don't have any strong interests so my preferences for a job right now are location and salary/benefits. I planned to stick with engineering roles, which is what I have now. The deal breaker for me was I researched consultants work consistently 50-60+ hours a week and it's very front facing so it seemed no matter how I weaseled around that it would probably be too high stress/burnout for me. I'd like to say I enjoy working with people but all day where your job depends on it, not so sure. Otherwise the career seemed to fit into what I wanted: constant learning, challenging work, hard work, leading, teamwork, money. This seem like a valid reason to not pursue consulting?
tcqj4y	1647118195	503	Hey all,I’m so glad I discovered this group!I am turning 31 this month, and am at a crossroads with my career. I am trying to pinpoint my passion and where specifically my interest and skills will take me next.I’ve been teaching special education for 5+ years, and I am genuinely beyond burnout. I absolutely love working with my students, love the relationship we developed, and love getting to bond with my coworkers who have turned into like another little family.But, I would be lying if I said my mental health hasn’t suffered. I used to be a pretty optimistic person, and still relatively am, but now I struggle with so much more anxiety, and my motivation and zest for life has dwindled away. Even if I am not at work, I’m thinking about work, which causes extreme anxiety. There just is not enough allotted time in the day, to complete the things needed of me, as a  SPED teacher. I do struggle with time management, and the many other things that come from having a deficit in attention, but that has never stopped me from meeting deadlines and getting ish done.Anyway, I’ve been trying to figure out what my passion is. The type of work that energizes me, involves interacting with people, building relationships , and helping others. That is so…broad. It’s difficult to narrow down. I prefer to have a work day that has some excitement, some adversity, and may resemble teaching such as having the same class schedule and students, but each day looks different, you never know what can happen. I career That keeps me engaged, and allows me to feel accomplished. I am a person who is confident and optimistic when it comes to adversity and gladly accept challenges within work and outside of it, but those challenges should be within my reach, or my confidence and my the belief in my ability to do my job begins to suffer.Some of the things I do for side work or gigs include Ubering(started 5 years ago and love it, Altho the pay Can suck), coaching basketball 🏀, blogging &amp; writing, and helping my husband with his handyman business at times. I have no clue where to start. It’s definitely scary, and exciting at the same time, to finally get out of my comfort zone and force myself to do something different. Something that I have a passion for that I will actually look forward to and be okay with getting out of bed in the morning instead of the sinking feeling in my stomach I have experienced for some years.Any teachers left the field, if so where did you go? What did you do?I have looked into maybe driving for fedex or ups, usps. Becoming a Realtor, life coach or counseling interests me a lot, but I would need to go back to school for it.Also thought about non-traditional careers  such as blogging, starting my own business, etc.I’m open to any and all ideas or advice. Thanks in advance
tbpfj4	1647002989	827	Hi guys! I wanted to share with you my  journey for the past 2 years of what I wanted to do with my career and how it turned out to not be what I wanted this leading to a lack of inspiration and motivation for me. Long story short I work in hospitality, in michelin star restaurants. I did a 1 year total internship in Spain during university and during the 2020 pandemic I finished my BA. In 2021 august I left my home country for the second time alone in London this time. I started very strong. All gas no breaks as they say. I was working hard, training bjj on my days off, lifting weights, visiting London, going to football games and even got a promotion in the first 6 months. As this may sound and look good at first after a few months after december I started to feel burnt out. Working 12-13 hour shift with 5-6 hours sleep in between shifts. With the promotion I got more money but it came with more hours worked. I work an average of 55-60 hours a week and also commuting for 45 mins each way. During working here I was also treated as a door mat a lot of the times. The managers saw that I am pushing and doing a very good job therefore I was the only one being asked to do favours like stay some OT or can you come earlier today at work the manager texting me at 7:30 am before that working 13 hours the day before. Don't know how I ended up here but I ended up just working and getting home absolutely dead tired. On my off days I have no motivation to go and workout or go to a bjj class. I ended up abusing weed smoking almost everyday. I stay home as well all day doing nothing because I am just to dead tired from these long shifts. The upside is that I am able to save some money but at what cost? My sleep is almost non existent (I put my alarm at 9:30 am and wake up at 7 and can't go back to sleep this while going to sleep at 2 am), I am losing a lot of weight because my appetite is very low I bearly eat anything all day. I feel very stuck and don't know what to do. My first decision would be to just quit and go back to my home country. But I don't know if I will regret this decision. I really don't know what to do and feel stuck. What do you guys suggest? Because by every week passed I just don't want more and more to not work in this field and in this country. I tried to also have a romantic life by going out on dates but every time we couldn't find common ground on our date time to meet. Or we would go on 1-2 dates but it would stop there. I had a shroom trip a week ago to help me lift my mood and have a bit of clarity in the way my emotions and thoughts flow through me. But after 2 days I was right back in the 13 hours grind shift. What do you guys suggest I do or how do you see this situation from an outside perspective? I feel it is not worth it to grind away my time, health, sleep and personal life for the £. On one side I win better money on the other side I have sacrificed my personal life, health and sleep for it. I also thought that I am wining like a wanker and always find excuses to my situation and try to claim responsibility. This would mean me continuing to work this job and forcing myself through this lack of sleep and lack of motivation to push through and go to train bjj, lift weight and go have a romantic life while working 60 hour weeks with 3 x  13 hours shifts and 2 x 10 hour shifts a week but inevitably this will lead to burnout. Or here as well maybe I'm just wining like a wanker should just shut the f up and keep moving forward. This is what most people tell me. "Hey just shut up and work! When I was your age I would work 25 hours a day 366 days a year!" That's literally what people tell me when I ask for support. (I'm 24 btw). Don't know what to do right now and I became desperate. The thing is if I quit for my wellbeing and go back to my home country my mind/ego views this as a major failure and this automatically make me suffer even more because I was the one who wanted to come to london and work this job not knowing in what I'm getting into.  Sorry for the long post guys. Any response is welcomed! Thanks!
ta7ht2	1646831562	245	Hi everyone,I (31F) started having burnout year ago, I was at previous work 4 years (QA in known european cybersec company) and at last year our project was succesful enough that company focused mainly on it and all the pressure went really high, we've got a lot of clients and all expectations were on us to deliver. I loved this work before, but it all crumbled, I started having panick attacks and couldn't focus at all. My manager recommended change of environment, I moved to Amsterdam to company that had good reviews and female CEO (which as female in tech I really admire) and I was happy just to find out I am under toxic micromanaging boss (which was exception in overall good company) who made people hate QAs in company. He left and after all stress with it I caught bad covid, struggled a lot to recover, and went back to work with burnout bigger than ever. I am 7 months in now, pressure is high, company is focused on really fast deliver, no QA process at all and everyone in prejudiced to us while I struggle to finish any task and just simply break out crying a few times a day, or give up overall on trying. I have panick attacks all day long, I am lost what to do. It just feels like I regressed so much and lost any motivation. I used to love working in tech, now I am just depressed.

ta6jgh	1646828176	300	Hi there! I’m looking for feedback from the community about my current employment situation and life plans.I am 30 and currently living in a medium sized city in the Midwest. I have a master’s degree in clinical mental health counseling, practiced as a therapist for about 7 years, and am currently doing more case management/administrative work for the past 2 years (primarily work from home but need to be in the area). To be honest, there is a degree of burnout after so many years of dealing with constant human misery.My husband and I are in the process of building a conversion bus- this is a major dream of his that I am starting to get more excited about. We have sold our house and are close to completing the project. Our goal is to travel full time for a couple of years and eventually settle down in a new area, probably further west (we have friends in Colorado and are fond of the area).We are both seeking fully remote jobs that we can do traveling. I have an offer for a full time, fully remote job that would allow me to continue qualifying for public service loan forgiveness (a big plus for me), but the pay is as low as my first job out of college, a little over half of my current salary. It is more of a customer service role that doesn’t require much more than good typing and communication skills. Probably will be mind-numbing work but a part of me thinks that may be a nice break.I have a lot of anxiety about backsliding in my career and fear that something better won’t come along. Is it worth transitioning into this job to start traveling while continuing to look for something fully remote that is higher paying?
t9s1th	1646776820	277	Current Job is Pushing me over the edge: 50/60 hour work weeks that will likely not end, I do not get along with program leadership (poor cultural fit), and recently I made an error that will cost the program schedule (first time I've done so in my entire career). I think the error was partially the result of overworking myself and just missing it - I've noticed I'm starting to lose concentration/forgetting things/etc due to burnout. I literally missed something fairly big - which is not like me at all. this is a sign that I am suffering from burnout - as this usually happens when I work too much in the past. Obviously, I am own the mistake and understand its still my responsibility.So here I am, working 55-60 hours a week, with poor perception by program leadership, just made a critical error, and will likely continue working 55-60 hours in the near term. I think my future growth potential at this company is now tarnished due to this project.I'm seriously just considering outright quitting, in the next few weeks (I'd give a two weeks notice). I have around 40K in savings - enough last me 9-10 months. I have 12 years experience in engineering - so I Can likely find a nother job fairly quickly if I want.I feel like I've dug a ditch to deep to recover and my time is better spent joining a new company and starting from scratch (after I take a brief sabbatical) continuing to work 50-60 hours a week and knowing my career growth is stuntedWhat makes this tough is that there are rumors we are headed into a recesssion

t94icw	1646701174	218	Graduated with a degree in computer science/econ but I hated it. I despised school but I finished it anyway to make everyone around me happy. These past two years I have worked crazy long hours in manual labor while applying to jobs in the tech industry. It's ridiculous how many applications you have to fill out as a college grad to even get an interview. Like I am probably at around 200 now in the past 3-4 months. I really do not want to work at an office but I am tired of breaking my body moving shit around to make 13$ an hour. I have no idea what I want to do, every job I have had fucking sucked the life out of me.  My parents let me move back in with them and for the past month I have been unemployed and it has been the most peaceful time of the last 8 years for me. I don't know if it is burnout or me just being weak-minded but I have no motivation or desire to work. Lastly I  know I am privileged and that most people do not have the luxury of taking time off. But I really am lost here. Has anyone been in my position before? Do you guys have any advice
t8zw40	1646688233	450	Just started my 5th marketing position (it’s been 1 week) and it sucks. They lied about the turnover rate and the amount of job is crazy. At 30, I am now realising that all my past marketing positions have been shit. Either there was an insane amount of work, or there was nothing to do. It’s been hard finding jobs, and there’s always something wrong. I stayed 2.5 years at my last position and it’s the longest time I’ve ever stayed at a job. I think I managed to stay mainly because of the wfh they had to put in place during COVID. When it ended, we had to go back to the office and since then I’ve been looking for a new job… I can’t go back to an office 5 days a week. Also, I had nothing to do and was very bored. There was no challenge, no growth.So fast forward to when I get a job for a great position at a company that lets me wfh 3 days a week and I have many more responsibilities. Sounds perfect right ? Well I just started a week ago and I hate it. I found out that the woman I’m going to work with almost had a burnout, that she had to beg for them to hire someone because they wanted to have interns instead. We went over the tasks and it’s really too much no one can do that. I already worked for 2 companies that overworked me like crazy and I can’t go back to that. Im really not feeling comfortable staying there, also there is a high turnover (which they lied about in the interview).Now… I’m thinking. I’m realising that the only moments I enjoy marketing is if I do it for myself (I have a VR center that I founded with friends) or for a direct client (on the side, I freelance as a social media manager).After thinking, here are the options I see for my next move :- Stay there and stfu- Try to find another job and leave ASAP- Try to explain to the company that it’s too much and if they help me with that then great and if not then I leave - Leave and have no job until I find something else in marketing - Leave and use my money to take a break and go for a 2 weeks retreat and come back with a plan- Take a break for as long as I need to and figure it outWhat would you do? I also wonder if I just don’t like to work and I’m being dumb but I’m feeling so sad I have to do something about it.
t8rrq9	1646667068	309	I only ever signed standard at-will employee agreements but I can't lie and say I've read the fine print of my employment. However, with the cost of living through the roof and my company raise being only 2% (with perfect feedback with "above and beyond expectations") i find myself struggling financially.My rent went up 11% from last year, gas/food, etc is up as well so I have been looking at a second job to be able to make up for the increase in costs. I never thought that I would struggle this much financially in a mid-management level position having worked my way up and having a bachelor's degree. I feel stuck like no matter what I do I can't get ahead. I came across some part-time corp jobs with "flexible schedules" and was thinking of just working two jobs. Full-time at my current employer and part-time somewhere else in another industry as long as it doesn't conflict with meetings and since I work remotely I feel like I could make it work. I am truly sad that it has come to this but it's been taking a long time to find another job that pays more than what I make. I find myself in countless interviews, making it to final rounds, being told im the top choice to then be ghosted. I feel like if i take a part-time corp job it doesn't matter if its a career progression or not its really just about supplemental income which opens up alot more flexibility and I dont have to care about benefits or anything. I don't own a car so anything that isn't remote is not an option for me for supplemental income right now. I know burnout is possible it is what it is. Has anyone done this? Is this a bad idea? Has it worked out for anyone?
t8etrh	1646619934	511	I spent my teen and 20's a alcoholic, pothead, partier, burnout. I sobered up and refocused on work when I was 29. I'm 31 now. Previously, I worked as a sushi chef, prep cook, line cook......then general manager of a fast casual...$55k per year, no benefits. Fellow burn outs, students or otherwise people who didnt give a shit about working hard or the food. I got out of there ASAP. I got poached away to be the kitchen manager at a better restaurant.  It is better, but only slightly. It's a successful mall business. This time, $70,000 salary based on 50 hour weeks, with anything over paid as a bonus. Health insurance and 2 weeks PTO. Boss put into writing that he will work my salary up to $85,000 in the next 5 years. That's about a $3000 raise per year on average. Contingent on 50 hour weeks, and anything over paid as additional bonus. Our revenue is anywhere from $1M (covid times) to $2M (precovid). Business is picking up again and once corporate offices open back up, our catering revenue will come back and we become more of a $2M revenue business...that is when I get more responsiblitiies and he said he will just bump me up to $85,000 immediately vs over 5 years, if I do a good job. &amp;#x200B;To me, this seems like about as much as a restaurant manager or kitchen manager can make unless they manage a very large restaurant  that is much larger than ours. I see $100,000 salaries for managers , but I can almost gaurentee that these guys are working 60 hours minimum per week and its a lot more responsibility and work. &amp;#x200B;50 hours per week is about as much as I want to work and still have some work life balance. 5 days work, 2 days off. That is good for me if it costs me $20k more in salary....&amp;#x200B;However, I wanted to know what potential upward mobility I might have from Kitchen Manager positions or Restaurant Manager positions that can pay over $100,000? &amp;#x200B;Everybody is always talking about moving on up, but a lot of that talk is from people with college degrees or grad school education. That makes sense when you are jumping from Software Engineer 1 to Senior Software Engineer 3 with a $120k to $200k salary jump, but not for restaurant managers. &amp;#x200B;I am keeping my eyes open for any opportunities, but I already have a $70k salary with full benefits, working 50 hours max, with a written contract scaling me up $3000 per year until I cap out at $85,000 with the same hours. &amp;#x200B;Should I count my blessings here and just stay put? A large part of me says "Yes" and just stay for a long time, because I dont see too many jobs that will pay much more than $85k with my only work experience being years of being a cook, and restaurant manager.  I don't think going back to college is going to be worth the time or debt for me.
t78hn4	1646483445	175	Currently working at a toxic company and am on my way out. New management, new attitudes, and burnout have made it a bad match.Lots of gripes, but water under the bridge at this point. Important part is that my entire team (3 people) have all discussed our situation, and all 3 of us are aggressively looking to leave and plan to exit on the first offer.Problem is that a new manager started 10 days ago (after old manager had burned out) and he seems to actually be a nice guy. In his 10 days he has demonstrated emotional intelligence, and made an strong effort to build relationships with the team. On top of that, the company clearly lied to him about the expectations of his position, so imo he's as mistreated as we are.Nothing the new manager can do will keep me at this company. My question is this.Should I be honest with my new manager about my situation? Or is it tactically imperative to keep my mouth shut until I have an offer in hand?
t6s5ch	1646425771	262	Hi, I’m an IT burnout that’s been bumming around low paid work for a couple years. I’m about to be 31. I got into forestry work, going to do firefighting in a few weeks but it’s time to set my self up for the future. I’m from California and while I can survive on low wages, it’s time I really work for what I feel I deserve, to be able to live here if I want to. I’m comfortable with a lot of things like long term travel, any country, extreme temperatures, etc. I can’t tolerate schmoozing (not that I could succeed even if I tried), or staring at screens. I’d like to work with other adventurous, see the world type of people. Can’t handle sales, coding, lots of white collar office work etc, just not realistic for me anymore. I’ve seen that side of life and I’m good off it.I’ll do whatever, invest in education, do my time of grunt work. I just need flexibility, to get out there, and lots of financial breathing room. No kids no rent nothing to hold me down, just vehicle payments that I’m paying with borrowed interest free money. I’m fit, educated, healthy. I speak English, Farsi, a little French.I have an in with working with a civilian contractor for the DOD in Qatar, sounds like pay would be good. But I want to see what else is out there. I heard logging might be a thing to look into, or working on luxury boats, but I don’t think I fit the look. Pilot’s license?Thank you.
t6igho	1646398804	329	Background: Currently in my 5th year teaching elementary P.E., previously spent about 12 years working at the YMCA in different capacities (childcare, teaching youth fitness classes, personal training), and also spent a summer and some change doing residential construction/remodeling, which was interesting, but not something I could see myself doing as a career.While I truly do love what I do, I am definitely feeling the burnout. I've been working with kids for half of my life and it's starting to take its toll, especially as teaching in general becomes more and more challenging. I also just want to learn something new. To learn new skills, and use skills that I may currently have that aren't getting challenged in my current job. Finally, I am looking for something that allows for more professional and financial growth.I get a lot of satisfaction from solving problems/puzzles and can get absorbed in creating things that have a tangible product (jigsaw puzzles/video game puzzles, art projects although I wouldn't consider myself artistic, fixing things, etc.). I have started the Odin Project which is a coding program, and while programming has some of the qualities of something I'd enjoy doing, I can't quite see myself sitting at a desk and staring at lines of code every day. I'm going to push through a bit more and see if it may just be a learning block that is making me reconsider it.I'm a hard worker, eager to learn, and really just would like to put my head down and work on something. I would also prefer to go into something that does not require me to go back to school. Any and all suggestions of careers to look into are appreciated!**tl;dr: Elementary P.E. teacher looking to transition to a career that allows me to be creative, solve problems/puzzles, possibly in technology or fitness industries, and doesn't require me to go back to school. Limited time sitting at a desk preferred. Also seeking more professional and financial growth.**
t6b5ms	1646370179	228	I recently left a role about 6 months ago with an organization - role was way below my experience and a "covid burnout" easymode for me.I left to get back in the pressure cooker. 110k salary. Dexent growth opportunities as the company continues to snag more resources. 6 months there now. But I absolutely hate how we go to market.Former employer contacted me in dissaray. They're lost on a technology roadmap I made for them, can't figure their way through it, can't get vendor support, can't even figure out how to cut a PO.  They contacted me asking for training and consulting to bridge some gaps, but they have A LOT of them.  I could easily leverage this into IT making a role for me to fix the ops team, clear their headaches.I'm stuck with two potential paths:One - stick with my technical niche (current role) in a company I'm paid well, but HATE what we do as a company.  Decent growth.Or two - get out of a niche role into broad IT. career shift, similar pay, and different growth opportunities, fucked up org but for a good cause.  Immediate impact.The difference is, I know I can fix the second org.  I'm almost certain I can't fix my current.... Wish I knew what I wanted to be when I grow up.How the hell do I weigh these?

t5shz8	1646316890	77	I am a recently promoted manager of 9 direct reports. The culture at my company is that we're on 24/7, 365. It results in burnout and constant churn of entry level staff. Our stated business hours are 9-5 in the employee handbook, but it's more of a suggestion than a hard and fast rule. To help prevent burnout and general unhappiness, has anyone had success normalizing the traditional 9-5 schedule? Are there any tips that can be shared?
t5ci7h	1646261541	252	I've been teaching in a public school for 10 years and I'm feeling the burnout really hard. I made the decision in summer 2021 to switch careers and sign up for a coding bootcamp to learn Java. At the rate I'm going, I should be finished with the bootcamp program in October-ish.I'm still teaching currently, and I'm determined to stick it out for the rest of the school year, but beyond that, I don't think I can do it anymore (lots of reasons for this, but I won't go into all of it here - the biggest is that I'm just mentally and emotionally tapped out).The final stage of the bootcamp involves a career service feature to set up interviews, so I'm fairly sure that I'll be able to find an entry-level programming job once I'm done with the program.I'm just wondering how to manage the (likely 2-month or so) gap between the end of my current career and the start of my future one. I have kids and a mortgage, so I need to bring in a paycheck somehow. My degrees are in education and English, so I'm not exactly "qualified" to do much other than teach. I'm definitely open to suggestions, though.Any ideas for temporary, decent-paying employment? It doesn't need to be related to education or programming. I've considered tutoring, but I'm not sure that it would be stable enough to bring in a steady paycheck, and given my current feelings about teaching, it might not be the best option anyway.Thanks!
t56rv3	1646245965	487	Relevant background: I'm in my mid-30s, caught between feeling like I haven't yet grown up and like I'm already an old man. For almost a decade I  worked in a niche position in the legal industry, with the same organization the entire time. I am not an attorney. If anything my background is in writing; I have a B.A. in English and I held a few low/non-paying writing gigs before starting my last job, which was my first "career" type of job. Without going into detail, my position was a psychologically taxing one, to put it mildly, and in recent months I left the job to restore my mental health and find an entirely new path. It was way past time for me to transition out. Burnout is a real thing. I am married and have kids, so I feel the dual pressure to provide a good life for them but also to provide for them the best version of myself that I can. There's the rub.  Fortunately, my wife (who is incredibly understanding and was encouraging of this life change) makes a good salary and has kept us afloat. I knew that after I left my long-term position I would have to pick up the pieces and re-invent myself. Since then I've worked myself back to having a clean floor but my canvas is absolutely blank. I don't feel like I have any passions left. I don't want to work in the legal industry anymore. Part of me wants to return to writing/editing, but I spent a decade pouring myself into my work and never writing for myself or doing side projects, so all of my writing is bound to confidentiality and I have no portfolio to speak of. I have a number of skills I used/gained/honed in my work, but I want to find a position that is entirely different from what I did.I know I need a job. I want to start something positive and feel alive again. I want to restore my personal value and feel fulfilled. I know I need a job. But I don't know what I want. And I'm pessimistic about my marketability in different realms given how niche my last job was. I don't know if this is the right subreddit for this, or if I'm even asking the right question. But I need to start somewhere. So, how do I put myself out there if I don't know what exactly I'm seeking? How should I "label" myself on my resume if I'm trying to do something different? Should I use diversify my resume(s) to match different positions I seek or focus on a single resume that sums up my background and my skills? Do I have to answer the question of what I want before I even start seeking? If you took the time to read all this, thanks. And if you leave a response, double thanks.
t2genm	1645938031	123	Having second thoughts on becoming a front end developer ( web developer)It’s not the process of learning what’s required that turns me off, it’s the experiences that I read everywhere online of actually working in the field. Burnout, frustration, getting anxious/depressed from sitting in the computer all day. Yeah the money is good, but I wonder if it’s even worth it. I kinda want to have a job where I work my hours, go home and don’t have to worry or think about my job. But it seems with web development (I guess programming in general?) it becomes your life and you’re always thinking about your projects. Again, this is from reading hundreds of comments on videos, forums, etc from experienced web developers. Thoughts?
t1b8mj	1645814677	293	As of today, I am twenty years young and I have become increasingly self aware of my job situation. I work as a sterilization technician and substitute dental assistant at a dental office in Minnesota.     I don’t particularly enjoy what I do on a day to day basis. I repeatedly live the same day over again, cleaning and sterilizing instruments, sleeving X-ray sensors, assisting occasionally for our DDS during procedures, last but certainly not least, my absolute favorite responsibility that I have…cleaning all of our assistant and hygienist rooms (14 entire rooms) every hour after every single patient, whilst creating resentment in my fellow co-workers when I fail to complete this task, even when they are not my priority in this particular job position. This has caused me to burnout, due to my personality I guess haha. I’m an ENFP on the myers-briggs personality scale, I am demoralized by mundane routine. Not forming connections with people I am forced to see every day makes me feel so drained. I am a fellow creative and my work environment is very uninspiring and passive-agressive. It is safe to say that if I continue down this career path that I will find myself unfulfilled and suicidal. I need help. I don’t even know my options because there are so many jobs out there that peak my interests. I have no further education other than high school and I want a creative job that builds off of my talents and a job that aligns with my core values. I love fitness and health, nature, everything artistic and musical, and I am fascinated by personal growth and development and helping others do the same! Any words are sincerely so appreciated :) 20, Reyce from Minnesota
t0tz95	1645760639	346	I have a BS in Economics, an MBA and 4 years in a retail bank here in Bangladesh and I have been laid off recently. I am looking to shift to a career where the work is independent and there is effectively no bosses. A good example of such a career would be a professor in an university in Bangladesh. They have no bosses. The admins only monitor if they arrive and leave classes on time. The department chair has a monthly meeting where it is decided who will teach what courses. But thats it. No one has power over you, neither the admin, nor the full professor, the departmental head and not even the head of the university. Unless you do something extremely scandalicious, or your teaching quality is so bad that people complain (which is almost unheard off), you will not get fired. Now compare that with the corporate world. I am in banking and my bosses monitor me over CCTV. I cannot leave desk during customer hours for 8 hours. So no bathroom breaks. They pressure everyone to work more and more until people burnout and leave and then they can bring in someone younger at a lower pay. The workload has increased every year. If we say the work is too much, we are called lazy and inefficient and told to leave the job if it doesn't suit us. Lunch is 15 minutes and there is no set time. People often take lunch at 5pm. People are verbally abused and yelled at for not bringing in enough sales every morning. Now obviously if the work was independent and there was no bosses, I would have been able to control my work and my work environment. I could work alone at at my own pace drinking water and taking a 5 minute break when I needed. I wouldn't be constantly pressured to work more and more until I collapse. So I am looking to shift to careers where there is effectively no bosses. Any suggestions where I can shift given by education and skills?

sytgjv	1645551795	246	Hey all, so I am a software developer in Ontario, Canada with an engineering degree and have been working at my first job for about 8 months now. I like some parts of my job but find it boring/monotonous as I don't seem to always have something interesting to do (sometimes I'm just learning new technologies) and I'm not contributing as much as I'd like in my work despite getting a good end of year performance review.I was thinking of making a career change but don't want to take a big pay cut (making $65k a year canadian). I've thought about accounting as I'm good at math but would need multiple prep and pep courses to work towards a CPA designation. I've also thought about becoming a paramedic however I've done some research and they seem to burnout fairly quickly as well. I'm not entirely sure what is wrong with my current job but staring at a screen all day while not always being engaged with work is quite draining (having to learn new programming languages/technologies then feeling ready to start contributing only to be told to continue learning/studying without actually touching the product). I have done some work for my team but it just seems so slow and somewhat uninteresting like I can't engage myself due to lack of interest. I don't know what to do and could use some advice please and thank you! Also first post here so hopefully I followed the guidelines properly.
sye8m6	1645503806	296	I have been in my current healthcare career for 4 years now and am thinking of leaving the field, mostly due to burnout building over the past 3 years. I've thought for a while that my burnout was specifically workplace/company related, but I'm now working at a third company and am still facing the same issues. The ethical, financial, and general "fit" issues/problems I have with this career seem to be consistent no matter where I go in this field or what setting I'm in. I'm beginning to feel as thought this job is not as good of a fit for me as I once thought, especially as my mental health is worsening.I've only been with this third company for a month now and I'm already feeling an extreme sense of dread about going to work. As awful as it sounds, I know I'm not performing as well as I used to and it really is beginning to show, which is stressing me out even more.   How can I go about quitting this job after only a month or so and enter into a new career?  I've been applying to several jobs I think I'd be interested in, but I'm worried my resume showing that I've only been at my current job for a month looks awful.   Also, just for extra background/context: I'm 24 and I'm mostly interested in IT-related and bookkeeping jobs, but at this point I think any sort of desk job like data entry would be great. I wouldn't mind working in a healthcare setting (like a hospital, clinic, etc.), I just no longer want to work directly in healthcare with client/patients. I want a job that will at least somewhat fit my introverted, anxious personality more than anything.
sydttk	1645502575	315	I’m 22M and graduating in May with my bachelor’s in nutritional sciences, but I have zero interest in the field anymore. Becoming a dietitian now requires a master’s degree and even after that, they don’t get paid well in clinical positions, which is the area I was most interested in. I also just personally do not like talking about/working with food given my history of disordered eating behaviors, which I’ve only recently been figuring out.I have no clue what I can use my degree for or what sorts of jobs I can apply to. You pretty much have to have the registered dietitian credential to work in the nutrition field, but again, I’m trying to avoid that. I always hear about people getting jobs unrelated to their degree, but I’m just confused on how people find them. I think my education would be applicable to public health related jobs, and I have worked with a crisis hotline so maybe something with social services? I honestly have no clue.Now, last month I applied to an accelerated bachelor’s program for nursing just to see if I could get in, and I did. It’s only 11 months long and would cost around 50K, but I’d be able to live at home after that and would likely be able to pay off that loan within a year based off the wages for nurses in my area. I’m not sure if nursing is really right for me (it seems kinda awful based off of r/nursing) but working twelve-hour shifts three days a week sounds better than working a 9-5, and there’s lots of options and job stability in the field. I’ve considered applying to dental hygienist programs too but am afraid of burnout/back issues.Just feeling very confused on what direction to go in. Not sure if I should explore my options with my current degree or commit to the nursing program.
syc1yr	1645497513	189	location: New YorkI started a job I’ve been wanting for years. It came at a weird time because I was at a job I was happy at for the most part. The work I did was cool, the down side was my new boss that overworked everyone to the point of burnout. This other job came along… and it was a job I wanted so bad like 6 years ago so I took it. I couldn’t stand working for my old boss anymore.But so much has changed over the past 6 years that this job is no longer my “dream job.” I want to do so much more and this new job is mind-numbing. The company culture is amazing and management is the most supportive people you could ask for. It’s just the work I do that’s killing me.I’m not sure what to do. How would I even explain trying to leave a new job in an interview? Is it worth it to look for new jobs or just wait it out for a year or two? I’ve never wanted to leave a job as soon as I started before.
sxrayg	1645442717	390	I am the executive director of a small community tv station. I’ve been here for about 10 years but I’m feeling like I might need to jump ship and move on with my life. We are entirely funded by cable company franchise fees. For years money wasn’t an issue because cable was the main source of visual entertainment for households. With cord cutting becoming the new norm our revenues are in a dangerous position. Our options are essentially to continue on until the money dries up, fundraise to raise our $400,000 annual budget, or approach the municipality work in to ask for assistance. A little about community access tv. We are a community resource. We cover high school sports, municipal meetings, town events and produce local shows with our station members. During the pandemic our efforts allowed our town to continue functioning because we were able to keep them connected through video support and remote participation. My team (small team of 6) has worked morning day and night to support this community. I did my best to keep them safe (I’ve been the only one to test positive over the last two years) and to keep their workloads manageable.But looking towards the future I am deeply concerned about our funding and employee burnout.  We already put in more hours than is healthy. And now we’re looking at a funding battle that will take up a large portion of our time, on top of the already busy schedules we have. Meanwhile i feel like I’m missing out on vital years in my childrens lives all for an organization that is most likely doomed and I’ll be left with that feeling of failure for not being able to save it. But after this I don’t know if I want to continue in video production. And I don’t have much of a backup plan. I’ve been working in the production world since I was 18. Now in my mid-thirties this is all I know. I don’t want to spend my life making fancy sizzle reels or trying to “make it big”I just want a job that pays well that I can walk away from at 5 o clock and be done with for the day. Remote work would be ideal. Maybe data entry or something similar. But I don’t know what to do
sxbhj1	1645391394	221	I (26F) have been working in mar/com for a national nonprofit in the US for the last 8 months. The work is rewarding, the job incredibly stressful, the pay way too low for my skill-set and the extra responsibilities I've had. And I do a great job, I have received stellar evaluations, and have always gone above and beyond to deliver quality work. My background is in UI/UX design with a B.Sc in interaction design.I do not wish to keep working there now that I've experienced how they treat "family", as they put it when I onboarded. I've had to fight HR for months regarding time off because I gave birth 3 weeks ago, I did not get what I wanted.I already work from home and wish to keep it that way, but I'm looking for a boring job, something that won't require me to squeeze all the creative juices out of my head all day/week long and leave me mentally drained.I don't mind repetitive work/tasks, and I don't mind strange hours either (I'm up around the clock because of my newborn). I'm just unsure which kinds of jobs I should look for that would fit those two criteria: remote and not mentally draining.I learn really quickly and am very resourceful and flexible so I don't mind going into something completely new/different.
svghpy	1645186344	279	I’ve recently got offered the job as a residential supervisor at a residency for those with severe developmental disabilities. I have a lot of background in this field, but I have never been a supervisor before. For context, I love helping those in need, especially for those that don’t have a voice to advocate for themselves. In the US, the salaries in this field have always been pretty bad. This is where the desire to help these individuals exceeds the need for financial prosperity. I’m all for the former. The director of the program (who interviewed me) stated straight up that the location I would be managing is pretty difficult. Not so much because of residents who live there, but the staff who work with them. Aside from the high turnover rate and job vacancies (low wages, lots of responsibility) many of the staff are hired from a temp agency that don’t have much background in that setting. The moral is pretty low and they need to be redirected constantly. The reviews on Indeed and Glassdoor are brutal. They mostly come from the staff who claim their supervisors are horrible and don’t take their mental health and well-being into consideration. Lots of burnout. I know I won’t be perfect, but I want to be a good supervisor. I don’t want to be the supervisor everyone believes will not listen to their concerns. I want to be able to balance the needs of the residents and the needs of the staff. But they clash.  There will be lots of training and support from the higher-ups for the first few months, so that is helpful. But still, I’m pretty nervous here.
susr8w	1645115119	376	The way I see it, a combination of both would be perfect.I will try to keep it short...8 months ago after 11 years I left my previous job mostly because of the lack of opportunities to advance my career there. I was feeling misserable, burnout and fed up after they overpassed me 3 times for a promotion.I found this new job and unfortunately I realized since day 1 I had made a mistake but I wanted to give it a chance. The company is great in terms of benefits and how friendly they are with employees. Lots of free time, flex time, vacation, PTO, they are paying full relocation package for me, my family, goods, etc. On the other side professionaly speaking I don't see opportunities to grow at all, and also I realized I am not a good fit for the job nor the company culture.Because of the lots of free hours I have every week, I have started to apply to other jobs (100% remote), either for getting a second job and increase my income and hopefully become financially debt free ASAP (only debt I have are 2 mortgages, 5 and 30 years), or to get a job that fulfill my professional needs but probably wont help much to get my financial objective reached too soon.I know, becoming free of debt would be awesome and I believe that is the path I want to go at this point, but on the other side, I also would like to have the career that I always wanted to have. Having both would be the best thing of course.I am leaning towards keeping my current job that provides very good life balance and keep looking for another job either in my current city or the new city and see how it fits (either keep a 2nd job or take one that fits my professional goals) but at the same time I feel overwhelmed everytime I get an interrview for a job that looks to fit well with my career objectives and think about leaving my current job.I know, is confusing and I feel confused, but just wanted to know if anybody else here have been in a similar situation.Maybe this is also a topic for r/personalfinance r/overemployed ???
stpere	1644994347	246	I graduated in December 2020 but started my job search a whole year later in December 2021 (needed a break from burnout). I know the job search process has been really hard for people so was expecting it to take a long time as I haven't been working for a year on purpose. To my surprise, I landed a 60k ( +benefits) associate consulting job at a small firm in my city (less than 100 ppl) within a month. The reason I'm asking for advice is that I know that associate consultants in my area (Midwest) at management consulting firms make on average 68k plus. Should I negotiate my salary and by how much? This position is for a new development program specifically for no experience grads so I can't really search previous salaries and it is in a very niche consulting service. I also researched that ppl in this field with 2-3 years experience in my area make over 100k. I've heard I shouldn't negotiate more than 10% out of college. For reference, graduated from top business school in my area with 3 college internships at large companies, 1 volunteer consulting internship at a startup, study abroad experience, and 3 years of additional customer service. I feel like I have enough experience to justify asking for that 10%. (Been working every year/summer since the age of 14 and developed all the soft skills and excel skills that were stated in the job description). Any advice helps!!

ss9lmb	1644842139	446	Hey, so basically I have my daily job, which is nice, but not as much motivating anymore as it was (the more I think, the more I believe is due to poor teamwork, feeling I'm kinda alone), so some months back I started taking some freelancing works.   Atm I have my normal 9-5 job, a fixed part time job and an agency which I used to work in project based terms (I took a project, finished it, end). My problem is that this has been draining me too much and my role in each of them has also changed.   The agency basically treats me as a "full-time" employee, which is definetly something I didn't signed up for. My idea was basically to do a project per month with them, like in a weekend because they were fairly simple things, in order to grow my portfolio since they work with some well known companies. But now they are starting to give me almost daily tasks into Asana and even got 2 trainees which they kinda throwed over to me to manage, definetly this is time consuming and the pay, out of the 3 "jobs" is the worst. As I said I was just into it as a weekend gig and now this as changed a lot.   The part-time job basically is getting more activity but I believe is still doable, my fulltime job is getting me into new things, which is great but sometimes I feel I'm not giving my best as the more I continue with this the more mentally drained I get.   Now with this said, actually I feel like there's not much point into putting more effort into my 9-5 job, because I definetly will not be able to go up the hierarchy unless my boss quits or gets fired. The part time is also not going to take me anywhere higher and the agency I'm serious considering ditching (they are becoming my main headache and the worst paying).   I've also thought about starting to look somewhere else for a job that offers me career growth.  Someone has been in this situation, what have you done or what would you do? Stick with part-time + full-time, just put all your focus on your full-time and start searching for a better opportunity or even going a different way and start your own company?   Definetly I'm aware that if just continue like this I'm in risk of loosing them all and even hurting my health as tbh the last weeks have been very difficult, I'm not even sure if I'm not already experiencing burnout.
srx4g7	1644798023	1523	Hello all, here is a run down of the facts about me:&amp;#x200B;* Mid 30s* Michigan*  BFA in K-12 Visual art education, and 18 masters credits in fine arts (never finished)* **NOT** willing to attend more college - but open to spending $2-3k for online classes/certifications* I would like to work remote or hybrid. Office is fine but for the love of god, no cubicles.* **Prior work history:**   * In college - fast food, customer service rep at retail call centers, day care, dog sitter, babysitting, call center rep for roadside assistance.   * Professional - 10 years in art education (experience in inner city, suburb, rural and charter, public, virtual).   * I also have done a small amount of free lance - photography (family portraits), photo editing (adding and removing people from photos), illustration work (drawing), and painted pet portraits. I interned with a couple dog trainers for a short while* **Desired work schedule:** Part-time, flexible if possible. Remote or hybrid. Willing to travel, willing to relocate as long as there is a large airport in the region. * **Any disabilities that could prevent certain types of work:**   * ADHD and Autism - but I mask and camouflage pretty well, so no one ever suspects it. I prefer somewhere quiet, not so overstimulating.   * Anxiety/depression - I am prone to impostor syndrome, stress, and burnout more so that others though - thus why I'd like to work part time, or have something that is super flexible because of my mental health.   * Mild dyscalculia - I do struggle a bit with math&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;**The deets:**Since being diagnosed with autism this year, I have found that my mental  and physical health suffers when I am over stimulated (too loud, too busy, too much all the time), irritable and stressed (students misbehaving), and dealing with a lot of unknowns and changes (pandemic, transient student population).&amp;#x200B;I am tired of teaching. I don't mind it, the job I have is fine - I am hourly and work 25 hours a week (remote Mon/Fri, and in person Tues/Wed/Thurs) and make over $40k a year (if there's no covid shut downs, snow days, etc) - but with NO benefits what so ever. Benefits aren't a deal breaker for me because my husband has good insurance.&amp;#x200B;I taught for 5 years full time, was completely burnt out and had a mental breakdown. I then took a year to work at a call-center for roadside assistance. I hated that I was treated so disrespectfully and unprofessionally - like I was an idiot or untrustworthy. So I quit that and then took this part-time teaching job I am in now.&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;**What I love about teaching and what I'm good at:*** at this school - my part time schedule, I can take on as much or as little as I'd like each year, both in person and virtually* having winter/spring/summer breaks* having real, deep conversations with students* building relationships and connecting* brainstorming with students about their work* creative problem solving* a scheduled day, while at the same time a bit of variety in every day because kids are a wild variable :)* kids can be hilarious* life long learning* creating online content - we have a school wide LMS that we all use, but my coworkers tell me my content looks amazing. It's clear and concise. They have me critique theirs and often time I find I am helping them with tech. I think my ADHD helps a lot, because I tell them when I see a wall of text my brain immediately turns off. So I want it to look engaging and clear so the students know exactly what they need to retain to do their work. throw in tables, bullet points, different formatting, pictures, gifs. I like to have everything organized and scaffolded so the students know what to expect at each step for each unit.* finding new ways to do things* making things updated and relevant* researching is fun&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;**What I hate about teaching:*** I have to be extroverted and "on" all the time, I am naturally introverted and shy* it comes home with you. Sure I clock 25 hours, but I am thinking and planning and prepping for many, many hours outside of that. So I say I'm "part time" but I probably do put in 40 hours worth of work each week. When I was full time I was easily working 60 hours and working on weekends* society's attitude towards teachers* students' lack of motivation or caring, even when I am giving them my best stuff and trying to make real world connections* bad student behavior* parents mad about stupid things (telling a jr high kid that I was "pissed off", teaching the art and crafts of Dia de los Muertos, anytime something is slightly magical - like absolutely no Disney movie clips are to be shown because of one family in particular)* not able to be the real "me" for fear that I will have parents kicking down my door to get me fired (I'm an atheist, progressive, and non-binary. NONE of which I share with my kids - and I wouldn't come right out with this at any job, but the fact that I have to worry about how it will jeopardize my career really sucks).* I can't teach my kids right/wrong and empathy - because the community sees it as "social justice"* the unbearable pressure and weight of the public education system on my shoulders. I can't fix it or change it. I am one person. I am tired. I can't defend public education anymore when politicians are dismantling my job* the political environment. It's very hard to navigate these days - especially because I work in a conservative and religious community* I am very sensitive to people's emotions, so I carry a lot of what my students are going through with me. Hyper-empathy* I NEVER EVER EVER get to do my own creative projects!!!!* I spend a lot of my own money buying supplies so my students can have a full art experience* every 5 years in order to renew my license I have to do 150 hours of continued learning to prove I'm good enough to do my job. This would be great if ANY of it pertained to my field (art education) but it NEVER does. It is a waste of my time and a stupid hoop to jump through. If I do go to an art ed conference, I have to pay out of my own pocket AND the time spent doesn't count towards my 150 hours, even though it was a professional engagement.&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;I'm in a position where next year I can ask to only be on campus 2 days, or take less virtual work, or whichever fits best. This will work as prepare for a new job/career. I'd like to at least make $30k/year. Benefits are covered by my husband, but I do worry about retirement/savings (I will not be vested in the district's pension for another 7 years). I don't mind spending $2-3k to take some online classes or buy learning materials, but absolutely NO more college. I prefer remote or hybrid work. I'd also like to use my creative skills in some way, or at least get to brain storm lots about problem solving ideas.&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;**Thoughts:*** **Being a self-employed artist** (risky, won't make much money - I just want enough to pay the bills). I'm thinking Etsy shop with stock photos, stock art, prints, crafts, etc.* **Teaching artist with my own art studio** \- I envision it being like a "maker space" for kids. I have all these organize art supplies, maybe an area for green screen, stop motion, and audio recordings. It could be a place to kids/teens to hang out after school and on weekends. I could sell snacks and soda. - The problem is finding affordable commercial real estate, and again, starting a business is risky. Liabilities?* **~~Art thereapist.~~** ~~NO!!!! I am not going back to college for another $50k of debt~~* **Web design/UX** \- I'm tech saavy, I like to make things look aesthetically pleasing but also be functionable. I don't quite know if I'm understanding what this job entails though, or if I'd be qualified. I haven't coded since my 1998 angelfire/geocities days.* **Dog training/massage** \- I LOVE DOGS. I love dog behavior science. I can't stand dog OWNers though. You thinking trying to teach a student is hard? Dealing with apathetic parents? Try teaching a dog owner who thinks it'd be a lot quicker and easier to IGNORE your advice and just use a shock collar instead. Also, dog massage requires that I be a licensed Vet Tech in many areas* **Stay at home dog mom** \- my husband said no. Boo.&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;***Tl;dr I'm an art teacher in my 10th year, recently dx with autism. I'm tired (literally) from teaching. Due to my autism I'm looking for part time hybrid or remote, sensory-friendly work in a creative role that I don't need more college for. What am I qualified for? Do my skills transfer to anything else?***
sr9eiy	1644724341	186	Hello everyone, first time poster here. Recently, the fiance and I have been debating on making big career moves. We're currently both paramedics in Missouri. Shes leaning towards accounting and I'm leaning more towards a trade (plumbing, hvac, electrical, etc). This is mostly due to the current state of the healthcare system and in all honesty a little burnout. We're set to continue into another medical career together, but we arent opposed to switching and honestly at this point there is green grass on both sides. Our priorities are definitely more family time and general stability with income second to that. Currently we both work odd schedules with alternating 12s (4 on 4 off) so every month is different. I make just over 60k after 8 years on. This includes specialty certs like FP-C. How comparable is time/schedule for the trades? Hows the income? Ive looked into it plenty however im usually given a wide range and im looking more for an average. Is running a business worth it in regards to trades? Honestly not sure what else to put/ask here. I appreciate everyones input. Thank you!

sr2w3g	1644704614	56	I am a 33 year old that has been in elementary education for the past 5 years. It is beyond stressful and has negatively impacted my physical and mental health to the point of burnout. I hold a bachelors of science in elementary education. Any other careers that are solid alternatives that don’t require much more schooling?
spv7p8	1644570931	107	Been in sales for 3 years. Finished uni at 22. Worked part time until 25. Full time ever since with weekend work on my second job to save up money. Been in Business to Business corporate sales since 27 in Saas and Fintech. Since turning 30 my motivation for sales and the money has diminished and I think I am mentally burnt out. I want something more stable. Anyone else made the career change at 30? Was considering something more technical like graduate school accounting ( I can just do foundation subjects and  the Grad diploma in CA as I hold a degree) or somerhing within software/tech
snwng9	1644358915	503	**TL;DR:** Got my dream software job almost a year ago, thinking of returning to freelancing/contract work. We have an education benefit at work, looking on advice on how can I make the most of that now.\----**Backstory:**I'm a software developer with close to a decade of experience. I left my job last summer to go work for a dream company of mine. Amazing pay and benefits, great work life balance, cool projects, talented people, the who shebang. I'm realizing now that despite it checking all of the boxes, it's probably not a good fit for me. I'm planning on sticking it out for at least a year.There's two reasons I'm realizing it's not been a good fit. I'm honestly still burnout from COVID and my last job. My last job I was the go to person for basically everything and a 60/70hr work week was completely normal. I had been working at that unsustainably rate for well over a year by the time I left. I didn't have a break in between starting jobs (which I'm realizing now was a mistake).The second reason is how much bureaucratic stuff that happens at a company level. I really just want to write code, but this is a large organization. Lots of time taken for team building activities, planning, etc. At first I thought I would like it, but, if I'm being totally honest with myself, I really miss some of the chaos from my old company which allowed me to just get shit done. I had a lot of autonomy that's not possible at a company of this size (old company was under 100 people, new one is over 1k).&amp;#x200B;I look back on my career and the time I was the happiest, most content was also the time I was making the least amount of money. I owned my own (verrrry unsuccessful) business and a few regular freelancing gigs. I would have continued with that except I was barely staying above water financially. I loved the flexibility and autonomy that working for myself provided, but also acknowledge there's several benefits that come with "working for the man". I do currently have one regular client I work with (about 20 hours/month).As a backup plan to this, I've also considered just taking a month or two off and then looking for a smaller company where I can get my hands dirtier.**On to the advice part...*** My current company has an education benefit of around $1k. How can I use this to my advantage to set myself up for success when I go it again on my own?   * The condition is that the expense has to be justifiably related to my current role in software (skillshare, audible, textbooks would all be fine, for example)* Over the next few months, any advice on staying motivated at work while still staying focused on my goal of going out on my own?* What can I be doing now over the next several months to lay a good foundation for freelancing?
snvj8p	1644356114	159	I don't know why this is stressing me out so much, but I feel guilty about leaving my current job. I work for a small consulting firm and have been here for about 1.5 years (first job out of college). There are less than 5 of us in our department (also, one coworker just resigned a few weeks ago). I got this job during peak COVID (2020), and it was never really my dream job. The work is fine and I get paid well, but I'm not super passionate about the projects and the work environment isn't great. I've been applying to other jobs and just feel guilty about potentially leaving since we are such a small group, and they do like me a lot. I've been looking for larger companies with more global and impactful projects. Is it stupid of me to feel bad? Am I just experiencing burnout and looking for something better? I'm just feeling conflicted. Advice?
sn5ef2	1644278948	575	TL;DR I’m 22 and have a good, stable office job and will be promoted less than 1 year into the role, but I’m burnt out and want to quit. I have a second gig as a tech recruiter which I actually enjoy a lot and am considering switching full time to, but not sure if I’m being too short-sighted on this (have been working the role for less than a month, would wait a couple more months to see how I feel then). Advice is appreciated. I’m currently 22 and work as an analyst for a market research agency. I actually started out as an intern during my senior year of college, and they liked me so much they offered me a full time role upon my graduation (they had to make the case to HR that it would make financial sense to hire me—hiring was still frozen due to the pandemic).I accepted gladly because I did enjoy my work at the time and I really like the people there. Seriously, it was definitely the people that sold me—my manager is amazing and caring and has helped me at every step. I feel extremely lucky to have started my first job at this company. On the other hand, I also feel extremely burnout. It started a few months ago. I’ve been completing my work slowly and consuming more caffeine than I usually do to keep my focus and complete my tasks, which I hate bc I feel awful in the evenings. And honestly, I just don’t feel engaged with my work anymore. I realized that this isn’t something I want to do for the next 5 years even. However, my manager let me know that they intend on promoting me in March (they would have done it sooner, but it’s another HR thing), so now I feel obligated to stay. I think it’d look great on my resume that I was promoted less than 1 year into the role, so that’s my reasoning. The second part to this story is that I started a second gig as a recruiter (contractor role) in January, which I do work for in the evenings and weekend after my primary job. I started because I wanted to earn extra $$ to build up my savings, and I actually really like the work. It feels invigorating and I feel like I can see the direct impact of my efforts (helping people achieve the careers they want). And I enjoy talking with people as well—I’ve met some really interesting candidates and my coworkers are fun to work with. I also enjoy the independence and how I can directly be rewarded for my work with commissions. I’m torn because I think my original job offers a lot of stability and recruiting is less secure (there’s probably a higher chance of me getting laid off in the next economic crisis or pandemic). On the other hand, I don’t see myself in my current role for even the next 5 years.My third option would be to try pivoting to data science since I work with data in my current role, have done statistical modeling in the past for coursework, and I enjoy that aspect of the work. Sorry for such a long post. I feel like I’m stuck. I’m scared I’ll regret transitioning full time to recruiting. I know I’m only 22 but it sucks feeling like I have no direction. Any advice is appreciated.
sn478y	1644275874	153	I’ll cut to the chase here. I’m 26. Been in what I felt was my career choice for 3 years after college and I’m so burnt out that I can’t bring myself to even do the minimal work. It sucks. It’s boring. I feel like a slave to my desk because I have to field calls and work tickets that I couldnt care less about. My degree is in marketing but I feel so stuck financially and mentally that I don’t even know how to make my next move. I want someone to talk to who will help and not just pay me on the back and tell me I’ll figure it out with time. I don’t need time. I need a fruitful career and a good salary. I don’t want to wake up and hate the idea of working. I enjoy work when I can actually make a difference. What do I do??
sn3gh8	1644274024	182	I’ve been freelance writing for about 3 years now. Last summer, I scored a couple of new clients and was super excited to work with them. I set new goals and started ramping up my daily word count to meet them.At first, I didn’t realize I was pushing myself so hard. I was so focused on my goals that I didn’t stop to think that maybe I should slow down. I was constantly fatigued, and writing a simple article felt like wading through mud. I also started to develop wrist pain from typing all day, which still hasn’t completely gone away.I finally took a break around the holidays to give myself the chance to reset and start fresh in the new year. Except, nothing’s really changed. I can’t even hit half of my usual word count without feeling depleted. And the exhaustion lasts for days afterward, so I never really have the chance to fully recover.Now I’m afraid I’ve reached the point where I’ll never be able to fully recover. Is this a sign of burnout, and has anyone else experienced this before?
smvesr	1644254229	398	I worked for 10 years to grow from an administrative role to an executive position in a best-in-class company in a competitive industry. I have an undergraduate business degree from a good school. Have been at the same company for 8 years (and a similar company for 2 years prior). Pay went from 27k to 165k. This is the kind of job that sounds very impressive when you talk about it, and has significant growth potential. Looking at it from the outside, it is a fantastic position. But I’m 32, and it has become painfully obvious that I can’t stand this “dream job”. I wake up every day filled with anxiety and crushing dread. Sometimes I’m too stressed to even begin my work, other times I’m working until midnight because the pileup is endless. I often spend Sunday nights sobbing because the cycle is about to restart - or because I spent the entire weekend managing a project that is falling apart. My boss, who I’ve worked for my entire tenure at this company, is intimidating and can send me into a downward spiral with one email (I think he relishes this power). And I fear he will retaliate against me if I quit. But I also feel like the job is killing me, and sometimes I wish it would succeed so I don’t have to endure another day. I’ve been working with a therapist to manage these feelings, and we’ve laid out a plan for me to transition out of my job. I want to take some time off to reconnect with myself and figure out next steps. I have enough savings to live frugally for at least a year. But I know it is considered career suicide to leave a job without another one lined up… especially a great job at a great company. I just can’t imagine what kind of job (or career) I might want. I worked for a decade to get my dream job and it turned out to be a nightmare. Everything looks like a land mine to me. So my question is: has anyone taken a “work sabbatical”? How did you explain the “burnout gap” on your resume when you reentered the workforce? Am I burning down my career by considering this? Thanks in advance! For context: I am in a HCOL area (California)…have a partner but no kids, pets, or mortgage.
smnwdz	1644232846	532	 Hi, I'm from Europe. I'm not going to tell about my whole life history in order to not bore you. Simply put, I'm at 32, my balance is zero, I do not have formal qualifications and I have a weak curriculum, but I still receive offers for full time jobs due to being in good relations with my ex collegues, ex bosses and old friends (from IT to restoration, actually low paying fake part-time with 60-90 hours weekly with physical burnout assured and putting on a fake smile for people I hate, or good paying 40h weekly IT jobs which bring me to overwork/learning all day due my slowness and my not being enough feeling and lack of self regulation/soft-skills and mental burnout assured) .As my dream is to have a lot of time to grow culturally and as a person, and perhaps get a college degree (maybe two ;)) but not necessarily, since:\- I would be happy to be a lifelong student and dedicate my free time to study different and unrelated subjects without a pre established path;\- or to have time to train skills needed on the job, without the pressure, fear and panick with the thought of not being able to learn during working time and not having time to grow outside that;\- or to have enough free time to learn and try how to start a small business without the fear of putting all my effort in there;\- or simply to have enough free time to distract myself if I'm again in the situation of being really stressed at work and feeling of not being able to manage that.To be more deep in my goal: I want that for personal development and acquire abilities and self-purpose, since I have a long history of depression, anxiety and an avoidant-inhibited personality and I do not want to abandon the dream to repair all what I missed in term of growth for having these issues during my teens and 20s (perhaps not all, but the best I can now).So in the end, I dream about a part-time job with an excellent work-life balance.I am available to expatriate to get towards the life I want. I see that Netherland is the top for part-time jobs but do not have free education (but I can self study without a formal degree); Norway seems to be the most balanced in terms of quality of life, free education and inequalities, but is far from Netherland in terms of part-time opportunities; Germany has the lowest annual working hours and good salaries, but I think less quality of life and work-culture than the other two (just some assumptions).Anyway, have you any suggestions? I'm thinking as a first step to try a work/language-learning experience with the few money I can bring together during the summer that some agencies offers here, to learn and practice english in the UK while working to substain myself and having some experience to put on the curriculum.I'm going to pretend with myself that I'm 20 years old, in order to not feeling the pressure about "you are 30s and do not have a college degree/real job/financial independence/home/wife/children/car).Opinions? Suggestions? Someone with a similar experience?
sl2gun	1644050982	217	I entered the nonprofit field in late 2019 and I feel it’s been a mistake since. I’ve now reached a point where I’m completely burnt out and struggling to make a career change. I’m trying to address my mental health issues but it feels impossible while I juggle a demanding job where I wear “multiple hats”. I want so badly to quit but with health insurance tied to employment, that feels like a death sentence. It feels stupid to leave my current position without securing another job to transition to. I’m exhausted and feel hopeless. I’ve spoken with my employer about the difficulties I’ve been facing and they’ve been understanding but I don’t know how much longer I can keep pushing myself to do more.I need help. I’m back in therapy but resolving my mental health issues will take time. I need a change sooner than later. I could use some advice on how others have navigated similar situations.Context: I live in TX (and hate it). I’d love to move but don’t know how to begin that process. I have a BA in Communications and have a couple years of nonprofit management experience including some grant writing experience. No kids, some emergency funds saved (it was supposed to be a house down payment but that’s another disappointment).Thank you.
sk9h05	1643967964	94	I am completely lost in life, I have a feeling that the direction in which I work no longer inspires me, I had a burnout a few months ago. I want to change my field of work, my career is not important to me, I just want to develop, and that it would be interesting to me. Previously engaged in HR. Can someone tell me how to find my direction, I don't even know which direction and profession to choose, maybe there are high-quality career guidance sites or career consultations? I am 34 years old.
sjz1f7	1643934197	287	For  context, i got a job in a warehouse my senior year of HS from one of my  moms clients. She has done HR for them for over 7 years (this position  was slightly nepotism-based)I  was recently promoted to secretary (front desk) and i am stressed. I  have a pile of papers that were thrown on me to scan into the system,  reports to do, and have to make a bunch of excel sheets daily while  phones are ringing for transferring people every 5 mins. To make matters  harder on me I AM IN COLLEGE DOUBLE MAJORING. I mean for a college  student making 21$/hr full time, this is pretty good.I  am a double STEM major in college and that by itself is a timekiller. I  graduated High School last year so i am not completely the most mature  or professional person yet.This is super overwhelming, i am doing a good job but i am destined for one hell of a burnout at this rate.Is  it inappropriate to ask for less work or explain to my boss that i am  overwhelmed and cant do all of the tasks he wants to the best 100% of my  ability? He's a really good guy and this job is like a whole family  dynamic for everyone there. But i just want to know how to elaborate my  concerns without seeming unprofessional.Also  to add, I need a full-time job (no matter how stressful it is) because I  cant afford adult life and the housing near my college without one and  my mom is paying my tuition and refuses to pay for housing.
sjkjqw	1643898506	345	I’ve been in social work for 8 years now. Got a BSW. First job was teens with substance abuse issues. LOVED them but it was a bit close to home and pay was shit. Then spent like 4 years working my way up in a DV agency from crisis line specialist through support staff to case management. It was usually pretty hard but still found it rewarding most of the time. Burnout started here. Left because management was toxic as hell and plus they’d never move me up beyond case manager. Decided to try and work through the burnout and continue in the field in new areas. Did a year’s stint in workforce development, that was kind of good I guess, then a short stint in supported employment which was NOT for me. Now I’m back in DV at a different agency, finally in a higher role as manager of a shelter/lead case manager, what I thought I wanted all along. Unhappier than ever. Job itself is fine I guess. I do enjoy supervising my shelter support staff and doing administrative stuff. I just think I’m done with social work.What other fields can I look into? I’m not hugely career oriented tbh, I just want to find something tolerable that can pay my bills. I’m open to a little more schooling if necessary. Like working with people still but just not in this intense of a capacity, and I’d love something where problem solving is more concise. A decent income for me is anything over 50k/yr. Some things I’ve considered are: teaching HS (English or history are my subjects), some kind of healthcare vocation like radiology tech or dental hygiene, recruiting. Love animals, maybe a volunteer coordinator at a shelter or something. I’d rather go into a customer service role than keep doing this longer than a year. I’m desperate lol.Do you know anyone who’s successfully transitioned from social work into one of these fields or something similar? Do you have any ideas I haven’t thought of?Thanks in advanceTLDR; I tried. I’m crispy. Need something new.
sjijaq	1643893095	151	Hello, I'm a business student and an INTJ who wanted to study neuroscience since i was young or become a neurologist or a psychiatrist. I've fallen into an academic burnout in 2019 but cameback on track, the reason is that i did'nt knew what i wanted to pursue plus was out when it comes to study smart knowing that i'm a Smart Student is ironic itself but whatever, i gained a lot of knowledge on managing studies and acing my exams. But i don't enjoy studying business it's like a waste of time. I can't change my major now its my second year.Now, give me please an idea on how to enjoy these studies knowing that my purpose behind education is servinghumanity.How to combine between a degree in business and serving healthcare ? • What kind of Business Speciality that will suits me the most in this case ?.Thanks a lot xx
sj7ld4	1643855875	416	Okay, I'll try to keep it short. A couple years ago,  I used to live in a tourist location as high-volume retail manager (think tropical/beach environment) It paid good money but it gave me burnout and brought out some mental health issues. Since then, I've done regular therapy and gotten some prescriptions to calm myself down. I decided that I needed to get out of retail and moved back closer to home and actually took a pay cut for an opportunity to be a district manager outside of retail. My district manager job ended up being even more stressful than the retail work I've done (don't do contract security! It's brutal.) My wife was offered her dream job and we're moving back to the tourist town. Her work is paying for the move and we found a good place to live. I've tried to get some remote work, but even with field leadership experience, a masters degree, and 17 years of management and leadership experience, I've been denied almost 200 applications. The only callbacks I've gotten were from pyramid schemes.I have an opportunity to become a business consultant with a local community college. It has good growth potential and good networking potential but the pay is very low. I would also have an chance to teach some classes which could be rewarding. I know I could be impactful there. Unfortunately if I accept this role, we'll barely be able to afford to live comfortably.My other opportunity is going back to retail and getting paid nearly double the amount than the college. I would have to work nutty hours again and there isn't much growth potential (I don't know if I want growth anyway if it has anything to do with retail).  I'm pretty sure I'll get an offer and I'm bummed about it even though it would definitely keep the family stable even though I'm taking a chance on making myself unstable again. It's also going to be a dead zone for creativity.My family that knows me thinks I should do the college but my wife that knows our finances wants me to do the retail job. She also seems much less anxious if I take the retail job but I feel more anxious about it. What's the best choice? TL;DR- Should I choose a job that pays enough, I'm unhappy about doing, but I'm good at or should I choose the job that doesn't pay enough to survive comfortably but could be more rewarding?

sj77qu	1643854809	213	I've been in my field for 7 years now and dissatisfaction and burnout are high. I changed to a different area outside the norm of the field but still somewhat related due to an emergency during the pandemic. I'm happy in my current role for the most part, but I am not a permanent employee so I have no benefits and make less than others in the same position. Management has advocated for me to be hired in, but has been honest that the decision is above them and there is a lot of uncertainty in the company right now. Many employees are unhappy with the direction of the company and there have been layoffs. I've been with the company for over a year. I'm considering moving to another company in my area. The position would be a pay cut but with great benefits and it is remote. It is a little below my skill level but the company is growing rapidly and has many opportunities for advancement or moving to other departments. Current employees have positive things to say about the department and company. I'm hesitating because this would be my second pay cut in the last two jobs and I feel like I am taking steps backwards. Thoughts and advice are appreciated.
sirpn0	1643816516	159	The main question is what are the main differences between actual burnout and just being exhausted? More details are below, but are not part of the main question. For some context, I'm a 29M,  have worked as a tech contractor for the past 4 years, recently switching from banking to hospitality. (Both large and well-known corporations, both roles were as a Technical BA/Data Analyst type role.)I've unfortunately been looking back lately, questioning a lot of the decisions I've made to be at this point, and if I should have pursued other avenues. (One of my interests while younger was to be a physical therapist/Trainer, and work specifically with golfers.)Regardless, I'm considering taking a sabbatical for a couple months, just to refresh and learn some new skills. (Most likely get more in depth with web development and API development.) I guess I'm also a bit downtrodden by not being able to buy a house, and seeing my parents get older.
shhhmu	1643676729	189	I just graduated with a BA in business marketing in May 2021. I started working a corporate sales position in June and have been working there for the past 8 months. Boy, did I know what I was in for. Since the first month I knew the position wasn’t for me. I hate prospecting and selling a product I’m not passionate about. I now know I don’t want to work in sales, but not sure what position to pursue next. My job is mentally exhausting me, I’m in a constant state of stress and anxiety. Every Sunday I have a breakdown dreading the week ahead. I believe I am too young to experience this level of stress, and should enjoy and spend my 20s trying new things and traveling. I just enrolled myself in a tech boot camp learning about UX/UI design that helps with job placement. Truthfullly, I would love to quit my job now, take a few months off to focus on the boot camp and travel (I have ~$30k in savings), and start my job search full-time. If you’ve done the same, how did it work out?
shcrz1	1643664559	289	I am a LPN working in the ED. I started this position only 4 months ago and I am absolutely miserable. To give some background, I graduated in December of 2019 right before COVID. I have worked as a PCT in the same ED that I am currently employed. I have worked as a nurse in a primary care office, at home as a care manager and now back to the ED. I thought changing positions would make me feel happier with being a nurse and I can honestly say that it hasn’t made a difference at all. During my time as a nurse, I have suffered with depression/anxiety, SI, insomnia and I miscarried recently which I believe was fully due to stress. My patients are lower acuity however, I am taking care of 7-10 patients at one time which does not feel safe for my patients or my license. I come home crying daily after shifts and spend the next several days dreading my next shift. As a LPN, I don’t have a ton of employment options that I’m super interested in. Being a first time nurse during Covid has been absolutely exhausting and made me lose hope. And from what I’ve seen thus far, I don’t feel motivated to become an RN.. I have been offered a position that is non-medical and although it excites me to step away from nursing, I have an overwhelming sense of failure and anxiety about leaving the profession. Has anyone else felt this way that left the profession? If you did leave, what did you do instead? How did you find your sense of direction/purpose? Please be kind as I am struggling really hard at the moment… any advice would be great.
sgoo48	1643592641	103	Title pretty much says it all. I’ve been in my first HR job (assistant/generalist - the work is almost completely administrative) for a year and a half now and I’m so drained and burnt out it’s insane. On top of the burnout and insane workload/expectations, the work is soul sucking repetitive robot admin work. I’m MISERABLE and I need guidance. Do I try to stay in HR and move up in the ranks and become specialized/more involved in employee matters? Or do I leave HR altogether? If other HR jobs are anything like this then I don’t think I’d be able to handle it.
sglp6s	1643584191	271	Hello everyone,Im new grad in icu and been off orientation for 2 months. So far I hate my job, I completely regret going into nursing. My mental health has been the lowest it has been. Before work I cry, during work I cry, and after work I cry. I am not able to sleep during my days on because I’m incredibly nervous. I keep constantly thinkings about the mistakes I have made and the nurses who get upset that I didn’t know. I feel awful that I made those mistakes and I just can’t stop thinking about how I accident caused harm to the patient cause I didn’t know. I’m on medication and therapy and still things are not getting better. I regret choice nursing as a profession I wish I never chose it. I hate almost everything about it. I came into the icu with the intention of being a crna. But after experiencing the stress and the burnout from the icu I don’t know if I’m able to handle being a crna. I’m always on edge about everything that happens with my patient and I feel awful afterwards. I was thinking maybe I should just quit. Maybe this isn’t worth my mental health. I’m became extremely unhealthy. I hate knowing that I wasted 4 years trying to pursue nursing when I want to quit it all together. I want to try to go back to school for CS but I’m not sure if I’ll the grass is greener on the other side. I really need advice and support. I’m very loss and I don’t know what to do with myself.
sgjf2k	1643577963	446	I've been working as a junior financial accountant for a real estate company for the past year. In that year, I was the sole accountant in a slim accounts team that included a CFO and two bookkeepers. However, we are a small-mid size company so the workload was easy and the company culture is great so I was really enjoying the first 9 months.3 months ago, we went through a team restructure which involved making the two bookkeepers redundant and bringing on two more accountants.During the handover phase, we realised how poor the bookkeepers' processes were and up to know all three of us accountants have been doing things we really do not like and for longer hours. My new colleagues and myself are burnt out.The boss recognises that everyone is pulling crazy hours and doing things they don't like, so plans to hire two accounts officers in the next month to support us.In my 1-on-1 with my boss (who I have a great relationship), I told him that I've been burnt out and so cynical towards my workplace that I've started to keep my eyes open to new job opportunities in other companies. He told me that after this temporary busy period is over, he has plans for me to become a financial accountant doing reporting and end-of-month tasks (things I don't have ambitions towards in my career path).I told him I aspire to be a systems accountant hence I have started looking for this type of role elsewhere as the company does not have this type of role in their plans. He questioned my career pathway ambitions as he thought I wanted to be a financial accountant not a systems accountant. He gave me a raise on the spot from $70k to $80k to prove his appreciation of my value to the team. The thing is, the types of system accountant roles I believe I can obtain and have been applying for with success are paying in the region of $85k to $100k. More importantly, every job ad I read for this type of role really excites me. So my dilemma is: Stay at current workplace?- great company culture- great leader who I do respect- decent pay $80k- con: continue being burnt out for the next 6 months at least.- con: on a career pathway I will probably only enjoy about 60% of duties.Find new job?- opportunity to find role in a field I could potentionally enjoy 100%- find a bigger company with more security and room to shape my career my way (I.e. Not be held back by small company wage budgets and capacity constraints)- attain a salary higher than the $80k being offered
sdokkj	1643253962	156	hey yall,i graduted from high school and going to start uni soon and can't decide whether to study medicine or engineering. I am really good at maths and  alright/good at biology. i wanted to do medicine however, the burnout and the hours physicians have to work make me not want to do medicine (heard they work 14 hours a day for 12 days straight). and for engineering I'm scared that it might get boring and repetitive as I read a lot of engineers get bored at work and companies can also suck sometimes which makes engineers regret choosing their career. therefore, I'm scared I might get bored and not find it interesting as well. if I do medicine I'm planning to do pediatrician and if I choose engineering I'm thinking of doing either civil, mechatronics or mechanical. so which one do you recommend for me to do? or you think will have a better outcome.Thank you!!!
sdmawy	1643247336	5	Can it be done without burnout?
sdkbbz	1643241550	671	I will try to keep this brief as I have posted before. I take little bits of advice but never seem able to put plans into action. It comes down to money. Not having enough of it, which affects my quality of life, which affects my energy level and ability to work, which affects my income and energy I can put into job hunting, and then I have this self-perpetuating snowballing situation I feel stuck in. Since covid started I went from working in a warehouse to being a camgirl on Chaturbate, to unemployment, to another warehouse, back to unemployment after that job caused a meltdown, and finally to driving for Amazon. My parents would not let me take a gap year after I graduated in 2011, so I felt pressure to choose a career path that I was not invested in personally or really even all that interested in. This resulted in me going to pharmacy school until just before the PCAT. I dropped out even though I had a guaranteed spot in the doctorate program. I'm not sure if I could have done it, but part of me wishes I would have tried. The pharmacist job market is oversaturated, but I would at least have a better shot at higher income. Music has always been my passion, so after that I went to school for music industry. My major was not specific enough because I didn't have a job in mind. I really just want to be a performing musician, and that's not something you can go to school for. So again I ended up dropping out. Probably would have kept up with it if I went to a better music school like my brother did. I'm at the point now where I'm so depressed I don't have any energy to cook for myself and mostly eat freezer garbage and peanut butter and jelly. My job is destroying my body and I'm constantly in pain to the point I hurt too much to take care of myself. And all I can think about is how I need to do better because I'm already failing. I'm making more money than I've ever made in my life and yet it's still not enough. I can't make a dent in my debt at $17.25 an hour. Nothing I care about is marketable, I'm not the kind of person who can do something I'm not passionate about for 8 hours a day, I know that from experience. I've had enough job related breakdowns to know what I can and can't do, and I'm not sure if I should brainstorm career options and return to school or if I'm sick enough that I should be considering some kind of job placement resources that I don't know about. Places either want experience I don't have or require things of me I can't do and I'm honestly ready to just lay down and die. I'm in therapy but they don't ever help. I need money to improve my quality of life and a therapist can't make that happen for me. Nothing that I could do with my qualifications feels like a possibility (retail, sales, otr driving, guitar teaching)  because I have too much anxiety, can't find any consistent customers, or the pay/hours isn't enough. My baseline level of anxiety has been too high for so long that if I try something that isn't sustainable, I will end up hurting myself in the long run. It feels like I'm not made for normal jobs and I'm eventually just going to kill myself from burnout trying to have a normal life. It's all so much worse when you have to deliver to normal people's houses and they all have a quality of life that would make you cry tears of joy and you have to go home to your cracks in the floorboards that can't be cleaned and poorly insulated windows and unfinished life. Is life normally this hard for people? I don't get what I'm doing wrong.
sdc5ak	1643220175	391	I made a big mistake taking this job, I only l took it because I was approaching month 9 of unemployment (I'm a contractor and my previous contract ended March 1st, 2020 and we all know what happened after that) and my savings were running out. I stayed at this job more than a year hoping maybe things would work out but every month it just gets worse. My hair is falling out due the stress of my job and everyone I liked working with has quit except for one, my boss. I think she's a great leader and is actively working to fix the issues she inherited from my previous boss. A good boss isn't enough of a reason to stay though because the manager above her + our department director are absolutely awful. They lack even a single atom of self  awareness to realize that everything wrong with this department is their fault. Instead, they try to pin everything on my boss who has been there 5 months and has done more for this department than they have in decades.   Toxic work environment aside, the job description was very misleading and my actual duties are far from where I want to be in my career. I'm a graphic designer by trade. The job listing stated I would be designing labels for medical devices. What I'm actually doing is making sure existing labels have correct information and fixing any errors because they go off to the printer, I design a label maybe once every few months. Additionally, I want a remote job and my company has an "always in office, no exceptions" rule. My coworker who tried to make the argument we should be allowed to work remotely was told by management we could only work remotely if we took a 15-30% pay cut and lost our benefits. I have to get out of here, switching departments is a hard no.  I'm very burnout have and enough savings to last me 10 months. I just don't know what to tell my boss since I don't have another job lined up. I do have a few short term freelance projects lined up though.  TL;DR - I'm putting in my 2 weeks on Friday and I don't have another job lined up, what do I tell my boss?
sd5mid	1643202593	475	 Hi all, I'm a recent school leaver who was just offered a place in an undergraduate medicine course (I'm based in Australia), which I'm incredibly grateful for - and still incredulous as to how I got it! However, my finger still hesitates over the "Accept" button.I'd been so doubtful of my capabilities that I had become heavily invested in my backup - computer science/actuarial double. For the better half of the year I'd been going back and forth between med and CS, lurking on reddit and other forums in hunt of information regarding prospects, satisfaction and salary. Now, I'm not dense enough to believe all those bloated, selection-bias riddled $250k graduate positions everyone flouts on these platforms, but there's still a certain allure to the field which earnestly piques my curiosity. It'd gotten to the point where I had formulated a plan to eventually work in the US for a good few years, for the experience of another culture, a different pace of life, the sense of independence. Oh, and their more generous salaries don't hurt either. I had also wanted to complete a few months of exchange overseas - med does not allow for either.I'm not into med just for the money - I really do want to help people, I don't believe there's anything more rewarding than being able to save lives and being the doctor who makes a difference. I've also read about the darker side of 9-5s and the lack of personal satisfaction that people feel from their jobs, intense burnout from always having to keep up with the latest thing in tech, wading through 5 layers of middle management just to negotiate having Wednesdays off. I'm not going to lie either - the generous and reliable financial renumeration of med is pretty sweet too - but as everyone says, there's much easier ways to make money, and there is a substantial opportunity cost of time: social life, personal life, FOMO: watching those in your friend circle graduate, establish solid careers, move on with life before you. I'm just not sure of the extent of my passion exceeds the extent of that sacrifice.I'm also aware that I can transfer between degrees and that it's much easier to leave medicine than it is to start. However, I also tend to be rather stubborn and I will see things through to the end, and slog my guts out to get there if need be.Yes, it may seem incredibly short-sighted of me to consider declining a medical degree which promises lifelong job/financial security for the promise of being able to graduate and start a degree a few years earlier. Yes, I know that those tech dreams are wildly ambitious and idealistic - perhaps cliche, but nothing is truly impossible. But to hit the "Accept" button on my current offer seals all permanence. Any pointers?
sd4z8a	1643200548	650	Hello,I am stuck in a company where I do not feel appreciated and I do not like most people, but stuck because I am training with them since the start, and if I were to leave before the next couple of years let's say I owe the company the money they put into my training.Not appreciated:\- I am often given shit work\- this is a job with hour rates that lead to a lot of competition among people, the chattiest manage their way up better, and as a young employee you suffer if people are not willing to share work with you\- I am an introvert, some people clearly talked to me that shy is not fun, into my face when clearly I am also shy. so that's the mindset I am in...\- I feel an imposter, because next to shit work, some tasks are clearly given to me in lesser amounts than to other people even by people from my own team. they will suddenly claim that they need to share this work when it concerns other starters but me\- these things above are not discussed, HR would be the worst thing to go to, at most i will hear something that makes it clear that the person does not want to share the work at a given time with me, and I can not fight it. I just feel for some unknown reason a lot discriminated. (I believe the shy part and looking young could be part of it because it took really a lot of time until I could finally meet some more clients - the job has a function to help clients)\- Next to that, I suddenly lost one of my parents and I found it was barely acknowledged, really. Everything seems to be done when things have to look good, but I do not like how things are in practice. No one came to see me concerned to ask if I was ok, more than asking because they had to. No one.I even heard from a colleague my age about another who lost a close friend another sentence of "yeah it is nice from this person because she is usually so joyful that you really see a difference"Again another communication of a strong general preference for the directly likeable. If you do not show off, you are ignored.\- lots of people of all teams have left the company in the covid period yet clearly there is no change up to now to the standard - again carry on doing things to look good.The main solution to avoid owing money back would be next to waiting and reaching burnout, or that finally they do not want me anymore (Without me forcing it, otherwise it still applies) would be:\- either to find a job in a similar field where that company pays back my old company but that's difficult at the moment and in my area\- to find a job in a different field, as the rules seem to disclose, at least for 1 year. However I do not know what I can offer to a company - I have done long studies, but there's nothing of that that seem to be of use concretly for a job around me. Only learning something new again could help but I do not know whatI do not specialize in anything that seems of relevance around, and having found love I have no interest in moving abroad again considering I reached my thirties already and have done that a couple of times in my twenties.Where do you turn yourself for professional assistance that will not ruin your actual career? I work in a small field where people talk a lot. I already see a therapist, but that is not a career advisor.Does that even exist for people that are out of university, and in fields that not everyone is familiar with?
scju9b	1643133932	88	Both fields interest me but I'm scared of being underqualified. ChemE seems to be more interesting and could be a good match for Japanese, but I would love to work in an international setting, travel, meet up with people and maybe do some project management/be a little more creative in my job. Also, I'm really scared of getting myself into the corporate world and potential burnout. I feel like I'm highly conflicted, stuck between science that's both interesting, respected and secure, and more creative job...do you have any suggestions?
sbajq3	1642990203	487	I started in an entry level data analyst job in healthcare over four years ago.  Over the last several years I've taken several courses outside of work to teach myself how to code, how to become a database administrator, and develop complex data models within multiple applications.  I've enjoyed learning the industry and working on larger, more meaningful projects, but that has fallen apart for some time now.Our company took on a major health record implementation and was considerably understaffed, leading to my supervisor and I being the only two working on the database and reporting implementation/conversion process for the entire company.  My scope greatly expanded, leading me to become the lead business intelligence developer, sole database administrator and developer for the entire organization.  My supervisor handled more than their fair share as well, with both of us working 45-50+ hour weeks for more than two years.During the process, I was promised a title change or rewrite of my job description, neither of which have come more than 2 years into the project and after a simple implementation.  Reporting and data demand have only skyrocketed and my supervisor recently quit and they do not plan to backfill the position in a meaningful way, they're just asking me to do more with less again.  Our team has been promised growth and that things will get better in 6-8 months for the last 3 years.  We just have to work a little harder for a little longer.I recently spoke with our leadership about my feelings on scope, workload, and my inability to take a meaningful vacation over the last four years.  Rather than listen, I was told that they're doing everything they can, but there's just no applicants (undesirable area).  I don't doubt that everyone is working hard, but that doesn't change my situation.  That doesn't change the fact that I've been covering 2-3 FTEs for the past several years.  It doesn't change that I've scored remarkably well on every evaluation and always asked what I can do to learn more and earn a promotion.  It doesn't change that several (well-deserving) members around the department have been promoted at least once, and some twice or more, in a far shorter time than I've worked in a similar role.How do I approach this situation?  Should I walk out?  I'm making more money than I thought I would at this point in my career, but I feel like I'm underpaid by 50% and have no career opportunities or development.  I've been fighting burnout for the last year to help my supervisor, but now that they're gone and I report to a new, non-technical director I'm being made to feel like I have to prove myself all over again.  I've been pressured to cancel vacations because I can't pass off critical work (without acknowledgement that nobody exists).
sb8fpi	1642984051	78	I have zero motivation to do my job anymore. I have no energy, I’m lazy, always annoyed, and more. I’m a mess. I am assuming this is burnout. The job I once enjoyed I no longer do. I have a performance meeting coming up and I am thinking about mentioning that I’m burn out. How do you mention this without getting fired. I can see my manager saying what can we do for you? How do you fix this?
s9kxzi	1642799156	243	I have been working as a software developer since 2011, primarily it has been API backend roles. Recently my current company of 2 years underwent massive changes and I was fully expecting to be laid off. Three months later I am still here and they tasked me (and others) to start the app from scratch, switching me from a back end role to a front end react developer.At first I was excited and I was contributing to the project but over the last month I feel like my brain is rejecting everything. I have applied and interviewed for new places but I have no confidence and feel like I'm a fresh graduate applying for senior positions. When I try to accomplish a task in my current job I feel like I am years behind my coworkers, they all have mastered react typescript and I'm in the corner colouring with crayons.Without giving the company away, it started as a team of 30 people and after layoffs there is only about 12 people left, out of the original 30 there is only 2 other people who have been here as long as I have, the rest have joined in the last 5 months or so.I know burnout is a real thing, and day after day I feel like quitting and learning to become a welder. I really do enjoy programming but my drive and motivation is gone. How does everyone work themselves out of a funk?
s8noon	1642698402	187	Hi everyone. I’ll try to keep this as concise as possible. For the last 4 years, I’ve been working in the tech sales/SaaS space. I’m not particularly in love with sales but have been fairly successful nonetheless. I was initially driven by the competitive nature of sales but that has faded away. The grind of hitting quota and it feeling like I can never take time off due to quota always being top of mind, my heart just isn’t in it, hence the reason for being here. Some people may say I’m experiencing burnout which could be true to some extent. However, I was able to swing taking 2 weeks off (only due to the holidays) and within 2 weeks of being back, I’m already sick of it all again (“unlimited PTO” is a joke when you’re in sales).I don’t have a direction as to where I might be able to go from here. I do like helping people. There are aspects of the tech industry that I do enjoy. Working remotely is a big one for me. I’d really love any type of guidance/input. Thanks in advance.
s8clck	1642661049	185	I’m working in my current company for more than 2 years now and the most senior employee in my team. Without going into the specifics of my job, I can say that my team provides crucial support work for other units within the company. Without our help, the work in our department will slow down significantly.The thing is, my team never had a unit head and the company overall has a shortage in manpower. As the senior member of the team, I am expected to communicate with other teams, guide new team members, delegate tasks, on top of my actual tasks. This is tough for me since this is just my first job and I am only holding an assistant position (the lowest rank in the company). When other teams request for help all at the same time, I get even more pressured and overwhelmed.For now, I’m looking at this situation as an opportunity to practice and learn new skills. But I can see myself experiencing burnout if this continues without positive changes. Do you have suggestions on how I can improve my situation? Thank you
s765qg	1642535527	277	Hi! 23 years old (USA) with a Bachelors in Biochemistry. I work in clinical research currently and have a little over a year of experience in the field. My main goal after graduation was to become a Physician Assistant so I began working in clinical research to gain healthcare experience to apply. I figured clinical research would be a great field to fall back on if PA school didn't work out for me, but after I switched into my new position as a coordinator I began to realize I hate my job because of the massive amounts of paperwork which multiplies depending on patients I also began to realize that I may want to leave the US in the future. I love patient care and would love to become a provider but the burnout worries me. I also am concerned about how being a PA would translate in other countries. I'm pretty sure that degree would be useless if I wanted to move to, let's say, Germany. I really believe that being a PA would make me the happiest, but I'm not sure if this would work out long term. My parents want me to finish school sooner rather than later so they can retire. I figured I could even go to PA school initially and work on another masters later if I do end up deciding to leave the country but I'm not even sure what I would want to do since I don't feel like I would enjoy clinical research anymore. Are there any other masters degrees in the medical field that would lead to 6 figure jobs (USD) in both the US and other countries?
s64lsy	1642427865	563	TL;DR "I (23F) am currently 2 weeks away from starting working at a new company. My old company has drained me from all my motivation to work and I have been on a huge burnout for the past few months, which is why I decided to quit. How do I ensure that that burnout won't affect my new job as well?"  And for those of you that need some more info. I have been working in my current company for more than a year. I started working there as part of a three month internship for my Uni, and they decided to keep me full-time. The three month internship was ok-ish, learnt some stuff etc, and because I still had to write my Master Thesis, and I thought that it would look good on my CV to have some work experience in my field (Machine Learning Engineering) before finishing my studies, I decided to agree to the offer.   The pay wasn't great but as I was still a student, living with my mom, i didn't really think much of it, as long as I had projects to do, and could learn more stuff, which I thought I had. Ohh how the turntables.... The moment I started working there full-time, my Senior left the company. As the months progressed I realized that the company had zero vision on ML, I didn't have stuff to do unless I suggested some nice features on projects I was on, the rest of the Data Science Team was excluding both me and my project partner from the DS Team (they are doing mostly Data Analysis etc while we were more into Deep Learning etc), which didn't help at all considering both me and her were new to the company, started working there remotely, and had no prior work experience (she was a Phd grad and started working at the company few days before me). So we both were very alienated and decided to search for a new job.She was luckier than I was since she had a Phd and in that field it is a huge plus, and unfortunately there are not many Junior job openings in that field in my country. So she left first, which meant I was all alone. As my burnout was getting bigger and bigger I finally landed a huge opportunity for me, working as a Researcher in a company with a clear vision etc. Which brings us to today. I am currently 2 weeks away from starting working at the new company. Right now my burnout from my current position is humongous. To the point I can barely get focused for more than 30 minutes, which is rare for me considering I was always the person to work my a\*\* off to do the best possible job I could, without procrastinating. I am scared that the burnout will affect me at my new position, especially because I will keep working remotely for the first few months (the company is currently renovating the offices and till they are done I will have to work from home).   Is there a way to just relax my mind, and get rid of the burnout somehow because it's really affecting me mentally and I really don't want to screw up the new job, since it is a position I am so excited for.

s5mt91	1642370436	579	This is my first time posting here, but I'm hoping for some guidance. I'm going to share a little bit about my situation for some context as well. I (27M) am currently working as a massage therapist for a clinic that is about 10 mins from my house. I've been a MT for about 3 years now, and I'm unsure whether or not to continue. I like a lot of things about this career (which I will list below), and some things I dislike/worry about in regards to the career/career path. Pros:* Agency/Autonomy over own schedule (which I highly value)* Compensated well for performed work (\~$70/hour pre-tax) * Low stress * Work CAN be rewarding * Affords me some free time (I do not work 40 hours a week)Cons * No benefits/vacation pay etc. * Hard on my joints (wrist/hands, etc.) * Work can be dull/repetitive/boring* Often work in isolation, which makes collaboration hard* Difficult to work 30+ hrs a week (due to physical nature of job)My main issue with the career is I feel like its very difficult to fully meet my financial goals purely trading time for money, without much potential for an increase in yearly income. I'm worried I will eventually be able to afford life expenses (house, car, groceries) and still afford a lifestyle (which is very minimal at the moment). I will admit that my energy and enthusiasm for this career has faded a bit, however I'm not sure if that is "caregiver burnout" or if its just because I have more of an interest in exercise, rehab, and fitness (clients come to me for more general wellness, and I've had trouble aligning my current massage practice with these interests)My first question is, does this sound like a career I should change out of based on my needs/wants?I've been looking at other careers such as becoming **a teacher or firefighter** (mainly because I believe I have skills that would make me good at these careers, thus getting more joy out of them, rather than just being a means to afford living), and each career seems to align with a lot of my values and interests. However,  I'm unsure if I'll fully enjoy these careers. I usually don't know for sure if I will like something until I see the in's and out's of it and almost experience a day (or week) in the life of a certain job/career. With this in mind, my second question is does anyone have any suggestions for ways I can find more about what a day in the life of these jobs is like? I've also had interests (or at least I think I'd be interested) in more corporate setting, like working in marketing, a Work From Home Job, or operating an online business, but I have absolutely 0 experience in these areas and was wondering how I might expose myself to jobs/careers so I can figure out if it might be a potential career area for me. Overall, I'm feeling a little lost on what my next move should be. Do I try to diversify myself in my massage career by exploring other areas within the field that align more with my interests? Or, because of my worry that I may burnout of massage therapy anyways, do I begin to pursue something new, and how can I best find out what I might like? Apologies for the lengthy post, and I thank everyone in advance for their responses!
s5djrk	1642345125	504	Last year, I made the decision to move overseas (on a work visa) and find a new job in a large, global city. Right away, I found a job with a very good company. I'm now 2 months into my 90 day probation, and I think it's safe to say I'm feeling what I think a lot of people refer to as "impostor syndrome".Every day, I wake up with this idea that my company isn't going to keep me, that they made a mistake by hiring someone like me or that I don't deserve to be in this role. I've been roped into a ton of projects and am now being asked to help with various things across the company within the next month, so I keep trying to tell myself that if I didn't belong in this role, surely I wouldn't have already been asked to get involved with this many things. However, I just can't seem to shake the anxiety.I think the fact that I'm from another country has a lot to do with it, but I also think that being in a much larger, global city has made me feel a bit insecure. A lot of people at my new company are really experienced and have worked with much bigger companies in the past. I also feel like since moving to this new city, everything seems to be working out so well for me and this isn't how my life usually went back in my former city -- so I keep having this overwhelming sense that one day things are just going to back to my version of "normal" and that my work and personal lives aren't going to go well. For example, a number of years ago I went through a really difficult period in my life when I was let go from a former job and it really affected my self esteem. I was also really unhappy with the last job I had back home and dealt with a lot of burnout. So now that I've finally entered this new phase in my life, I can't help but question how much I really have deserved it, as awful and self-deprecating as this sounds.I really love this new job and the direction my "new life" has gone into, and I so badly want to make a good impression on this company and not lose this opportunity. I also really did work so hard before I came here and got this new opportunity (I had my full time job and also did freelance work on the side to leverage my portfolio), so I really do try to remind myself that I didn't just get this opportunity handed to me or whatever. However, there are some days where I am really plagued with anxiety over it and I really don't want this to affect how well I do my job or even just my general mental health.Wondering if anyone else has gone through this and how they may have shaken these feelings off.
s3sog8	1642167765	176	i have a couple of interests so far which include being an esthetician, MAYBE a massage therapist (burnout rates are high so that’s iffy), electronic assembler, etc.however, i would like some input. i currently work at a dealership making $13/hr. the pay isn’t ideal because i’m looking to move out soon. my mom is emotionally abusive and i’m trying to get away from her. i love working here though because everyone treats me with respect. i’d like to note i have autism, so i burn out easily. i’m really up to do anything as long as a) i’m paid decently b) i’m not doing something insanely stressful and c) i’m not prone to extreme autistic burnout my interests include electronics, skin care, animals, psychology so far. feel free to drop any ideas y’all have. my top interest by far has to be skin care, though unfortunately i need to fork $11k for school and the program doesn’t offer financial aid because it’s a 600 hour program. should i just save and stay where i’m at until then?

s349yg	1642093825	136	I recently left the counselling field as a therapist and have been applying for different positions. I've mostly been seeking administrative roles (which I have experience in) because I want something with a "different" kind of stress than I'm used to. However, I'm not sure what I should be including on my resume or telling interviewers. During the most recent interview I had, the interviewer didn't seem to understand why I'd want to leave my position for something like I was interviewing for. I'm wondering if I should be tailoring how I inform future employers why I left the field? I've been telling them I realized it wasn't for me and I'm looking for a change. Is this something to tweak? I'm debating if telling them burnout is the cause instead to 'justify' it? Any tips appreciated!
s05mx7	1641773241	193	I’m a 28yr old (F) currently working in the private construction industry on the east coast. I’ve been at my job for 3-1/2 years. When I first started I was highly motivated, loved my coworkers, was happy to come to work, etc. the longer I stayed however the more the “veil” was lifted and it’s honestly one of the most toxic, sexist, unprofessional and downright abusive places I’ve ever been in. With Covid the last 2 years it’s been even worse (somehow) and I’m just completely burnt out. I look for jobs constantly but I can’t ever get a call back. I’m very organized, regimented, polite, and work well in a mix of team and independent environments. I love helping people and I do have a bachelors degree in social work but the only experience is from internships in college. I have experience with general office management, and construction contracts administration but nowhere seems to be hiring. I feel trapped at this job and in this industry. How am I supposed to manage being so burnt out everyday? Does anyone have advice on better workplaces/careers? Or is this just the status quo right now?
rzmztv	1641716384	158	I’ve been unemployed and job hunting for months with no success so I recently expanded my criteria and applied to jobs I’m good at but don’t enjoy. Very quickly I got interviews and an offer with a good company, good pay and great benefits BUT I know I won’t enjoy the work. I’ll do well in it but will likely start dreading it 6 months in and burnout. Should I take it and be somewhat unhappy while continuing to apply to roles I want?  I hope this doesn’t come off negatively, I know there are people that are in dire need for a job and I feel sad for that, I just really need good advice for this situation. I want to protect my mental health but also need to be employed. I am recovering from a lot of pain and sadness from a major loss in my life and I feel lost on top of other things.
ryewel	1641581934	461	Higher Ed job in the US. I also study at the same university to get my Masters. I'm planning to ramp my job search into full gear for the next couple months, starting with an application to a position that I'm so well qualified for that I would almost feel sorry for the small college if they didn't at least give me an interview. (It's an all women's college - my alma mater is an all women's college; the position is in financial aid/ enrollment with about 1500 students - my current position is in financial aid/ enrollment with about 15000 students). What I am unsure of is when I finally get a job offer, if they want me to start within a month, should I prioritize using my vacation time or leaving in good standing? Quitting with less than a week's notice would really put them in a bine seeing as I'm one of only 3 counselors at this large university and they don't have a single application for either of our other positions that opened up about 2 months ago. I also study at the university so I will eventually, likely, have to talk to someone in this office again. I also really need the reference of my supervisor in the future seeing as this was my first professional position out of college. Not to mention that if I were to quit in the next month, it would be in the thick of Spring registration (super busy time) and right before Summer/ Fall registration (even busier). I'd feel a little bad for leaving my other two coworkers to handle it seeing as the uppers work our fingers to nubs as is. Alternatively, I have a trip in the works to go to Norway as part of my 30 countries before I'm 30 goal, and to meet my fiance's family, in the first week of March during Spring break (so I won't miss any important grad school deadlines). I want it to be at least a week long but I might not have time for it if I get a job offer that wants me to start within a few weeks. I'd be forced to either **quit and go** or **stay and not go for almost a year.** I'm also quickly reaching a point of burnout, especially with my semester starting next week, so I could really appreciate a longer break from work. Plus if I quit without taking vacation, I'd get the pay instead, which would be about half a month's salary. &amp;#x200B;I know, I don't have the job offer yet. I don't even have the application submitted yet. But I want to solidify my exit plan and I need guidance from other more experienced professionals. What would you do?

rxvua8	1641521634	357	Hey folks, I’m looking for advice on how to balance chasing career opportunities and not burning out. I want to thank you in advance for your advice.Context: I am in my mid-20s, currently in a high-impact role at a large tech company, and I’ve been in this role for 6 months. I cannot even explain how happy I was when I got the offer because it checks all the boxes of everything I’ve ever wanted in my role. At previous workplaces, I did similar work but at a smaller scale and feel very grateful to be in my current role at this stage of my career. The work is both challenging and enjoyable (IMO anyway) and the work culture is good. I usually work 10 hours a day which is okay for my current lifestyle. I get compensated well and see myself growing at this company.The opportunity: At the end of last year, my manager got promoted and at a 1:1 shortly after, they mentioned that they see a lot of potential in me and want me to step into their old shoes. My manager was at a director level and did strategic level work, exploring new opportunities. I currently do lower-level strategy work independently and thoroughly enjoy it so this pivot in my role will put me on an even steeper career trajectory. This is the type of role that I thought I would end up in closer to the end of my career and I am ecstatic that this opportunity has arisen.Here’s the problem: I feel like I’m already giving 95% effort at work and I don’t feel ready for this role. I’ve always been in the belief that I should never be the one who says no to career growth and that attitude got me to where I am today. With this new pivot in my role, I foresee longer hours and even more stress in my day-to-day life. How do I prevent myself from burning out? I have already set boundaries for work e.g. no meetings before 8am (we all work in different timezones), no work stuff on my phone, and dedicated lunch breaks.
rxup3g	1641518454	158	New to this group! So I'm going through a moment of clarity on my career and I want to act on it but still unsure as I have a lot of anxiety about making big changes. I have completed some college for my Early Childhood Education degree but after working with children for roughly 5 years I'm beginning so second guess of this is what I want. I get horrible burnout by the end of the week as I'm working 7 days nonstop (my first days off in about a month are tomorrow and Saturday, yikes, I know) and while I'm working I notice I don't have that pep anymore. After seeing an ad from a university I think that maybe pursuing the arts degree I've always wanted would be a good idea now. A bachelor's in graphic design is what I would be pursuing and I just want to know if I should just pull the trigger? TIA.
rxp4e2	1641503578	364	 Hello,I\`m 29 years old working as Team/Technical Lead in an IT company. I give my best as I can and my personal life could provide. For now, I don't have any serious problems/miscommunication with the clients or my boss.However, for the last year, I work also with people which are around the beginning of their careers and one way or another I should manage them. I\`m really glad that I\`m able to work with such team(s). On the other hand, since these people are still young and, I can only envy for that, they require more work than actually, they should do. This includes working on day to date basis, including specific company projects and also internal for specific team tools.I have already talked with the people separately regarding the balance between personal life and work and there is something called "burnout" and my experience with this bad behaviour. Unfortunately, since the current situation, we don't have the possibility in case that the team(s) want to go out for a beer/dinner to hang out and talk more about this topic.We had a discussion with my manager and he said that these people "want to change the world" and as soon as they understood that this is not the right way to do it, will be better for them. And my responsibility is to take for this without forcing. Also to stop the possible competition into the teams.Such examples are:* Based on discussion with clients I say that work could be finished in X days. These people from the team say to me that they can do it much faster. And they actually do it faster, when working for 12 hours a day.* Accepting changes in the last minutes without discussion or at least my knowedge.These people are valuable for the team(s) and the company. They are making a really good job. On the other hand, all team members should understand that rest is not so bad thing and start thinking more "selfish". I have already discussed these topics with all of them several times, but from time to time there is again this self-proof behaviour.Can you please share how you handle such a situation?
rvbr6s	1641243237	179	I need some new POVs, please.&amp;#x200B;Here's the thing, there's a pattern that affects me every couple of years. I get excited about learning something new, I go and learn it, start to build a career from it, and then, around two years later, after I've become pretty good at it, everything loses meaning, and life becomes monotone again.Here's a brief context:\* When I was still at school, things always seemed easier to me. I grasped the concepts quickly, got As, and... was depressed during most of the time because school had lost its fun when I was around four. I kept going because the idea of me finally being able to go to college and study something different, that was uniquely chosen by me, sounded exciting and liberating.\* That's when that pattern started happening. I've dived deep into Animation and, now, into Translation – college-level studies, careers, and all that. But, two years later... Here I am. Bored. Sad. Unmotivated.WHAT THE HELL CAN I DO ABOUT IT?Is it that things aren't challenging enough? Am I prone to burnout?WHAT IS HAPPENING?
rta2n0	1641006355	162	 hey im working for a company 3 years thats causing me burnout and im kinna underpayed even after receiving a small raise half a year ago. I was thinking about asking for another raise but thinking they will likely say no since its only been half a year and my boss is cheap and didnt give the kinna raise i requested before during the raise meeting we had. If say i ask for another raise to my initial request amount and he again declines than i quit with that as my reason to quit will that be burning bridge with the company?if yes i think probably better not take the risk of another raise and to just quit with some other reason than money not to burn bridge. If the money reason is burning bridges whats a good reason to quit to not burn bridges?my goal is if quitting to leave with the possibility to come back in future if i chose
rsnq7z	1640933172	54	I've got that coming up and have some plans (reading list, stained glass, clean my house), but what kind of things could I do to help the burnout feeling? I know I can't cure it in a month and it'll take setting healthy boundaries at the new job, but maybe you have ideas? Thank you!

rs7d1i	1640885965	725	I’ve been working for a very small IT startup focusing on delivering specific enterprise platform leveraging the extensive use of Natural Language Processing. I’ve been there for over three years - it’s been my first job as a software developer and I was participating in the modest beginnings of a typical IT startup company lifecycle, including finding our unique niche, attracting first customers, designing and building the flag product from the very scratch. Now I hold a position that’s significant for the company, I’m respected for the things I do and ideas I express, I’m considered a crucial member of the founders team and even have my own small team of developers that I get to manage. And while I’m eternally grateful for all the opportunities I’ve been given to grow both personally and professionally along the way, I feel totally stagnated right now, burnt out and with no motivation to work creatively whatsoever. I feel tired and overwhelmed by the chaos that’s present in every aspect of the company. I know that startups like this don’t usually operate in the highly organized and structured way with clear, precise and unambiguous communication processes, but still, after these years spent there, I feel like we should have been past these types of problems long time ago. Yet, we don’t know how to approach managing our work in a consistent manner but can't afford to employ a dedicated person who'd help us with that, instead we try to do things intuitively (and that "intuition" is very volatile), what puts us in total mess. I lack clear vision and awareness of the direction for the company's future and I don't feel that even CEO knows exactly where he's leading us. I just don't know what to expect. That was bearable (maybe even fun sometimes) at the beginning, but now I just can't get rid of that feeling that I'm lost there.Even though I deeply respect my coworkers for their knowledge and dedication, and I could say that I consider some of them my friends, I've started to perceive the ever-present workaholic atmosphere as a super toxic work environment and something that I don't want to contribute to. Money isn't good too, but I've been convinced that's only the matter of time, as we naturally need time to grow and build a stable client base. I get that and I hadn't had a problem with that before I started feeling tired with never-ending promises and no visible, tangible outcomes. To be honest, I truly think that what we do is valuable and has a great potential to be at least widely appreciated but I'm not sure if at this point I have enough willpower and perseverance to wait until we get there. My mental health has worsened significantly due to the stress the work produces, reaching the point where it's barely endurable. I've been thinking about quitting and trying to find a new job, maybe landing a gig at some corporation where I could recharge my batteries and take care of a proper work-life balance, but I don't have any experience except for that one startup and I'm not sure if my expectations will be met. Even though I feel burnt out at the current company, I still want to learn new things and be better developer as I truly enjoy building software. I really would love to cooperate with creative people in stable and welcoming environment contributing to causes that matter. It's really difficult to think of leaving behind all the work I've done and I used to be so proud of, especially knowing that my contribution was essential at the time and it's one of the reasons why the product might be of a significant importance on the market in the near futre. I know it's hard to give a universal advice but I just feel torn and I'm not sure if trading the flexibility of a startup and the future satisfactory financial gains' potential for the less exciting, stable, more conservative (but also probably less stressful - at least in my imagination) environment would be beneficial, both in financial and self fulfilment terms. Or maybe it's just enough to wait it all out...Thank you if you got through that wall of text. I'd be very grateful for any advice or tip how to deal with the situation.
rs5nrf	1640881577	241	So basically I live in an abusive toxic household and want to go to college to finally leave. I am going to go to a nearby technical college for a future and to just be out of my awful house...The problem is I don't know which career to choose. I deal with all sorts of chronic pain problems and am suffering mentally as well. In my heart/gut I want to do hair but realistically with my situation I worry it will be too much mentally/physically and I won't make enough to be financially independent and on my own. On the other hand... I thought of going to school for information technology because it will be easier on me mentally/physically and the money/benefits are secure enough for a stable living. I tried doing some online certifications for information technology and was doing really well until I got burnout and felt physically sick from anxiety thinking about being the corporate world. I just don't know what to do?! I love art..people seem to like me hair seems like a good fit but also A LOT. Technology..on the other hand seems like it would be easier for me but i'm worried I will be like the guy in the movie Office Space and i'll lose my mind. I just feel sick thinking about doing technology for some reason..like a gut feeling but I NEED to leave and NEED stability...Can anyone give me some sound advice?
rrnxp4	1640825500	74	As the title suggests, I’m in my mid 30s and suffering from serious burnout in my corporate job. It’s not difficult, but I’ve lost all passion and find it exhausting just to get through a workday. I tried to change companies but that hasn’t helped at all.So my question is - has anyone experienced the same thing? Did changing careers help? How did you find the career that brought the spark back in your life?
rrdps7	1640799473	102	Hi Everyone, I’m three years into my post-university career and am considering to study toward a masters degree. I would like to do this while continuing my duties at work, but it seems like it would lead to burnout - especially considering that my work is already very stressful. I have in mind to take a break from work, complete the degree, and re-enter the workforce.How do employers view this type of work gap? Let’s say it would amount to 1.5 years or so. Would it be detrimental to future chances of employment, or is it generally acceptable. Any insight helps. Thanks you!
rqyqws	1640750930	93	In my last job I was working as an architectural &amp; interior designer for two years, until I got a severe burnout and left in December 2020.I used autocad, revit, sketchup, lumion, blender, PS, and more, and I got portfolio backing it up.The problem is, I left in bad terms with my previous employer, so no way I put my last boss's contact as a reference. searching a job locally is also kinda depressing, lots of responsibility and very low pay. Should I just looking for online jobs instead? and, how do I start?
rpwl3a	1640637097	349	I am a creative working in video production for about 7 years now. In that time I've worked contract while also finishing an Associates in Graphic &amp; Web Design, and a Bachelors of Arts in Advertising and marketing. I am mostly self taught in Film/photo prod. but I understand the NEED for such productions in advertising from the creative process, briefs, some analytics, appeal, goals, design, etc.That said, working for a new company for roughly 6 months, I was hired for my specialty in video production, advertising and design knowledge. I was hired specifically because of, "The consistency of the work from camera to camera, color grading, &amp; overall quality." My concern is I agreed to a position that is now so bent and warped in terms of scope and expectation, I feel I'm being used. I know this feeling because of my freelancing experience, and it's why I got out and want to work more agency/corp side. Burnout and pay are my main concerns, in addition to the micromanaging, and mediocre productions as a result. I was hired for my XP, but my process hasn't been implemented, steps aren't done or skipped, and its why the biz is attracting low-hanging clients. creating mediocre work. Not only do I notice this, but i've been asked and given input on it, additionally to input on executive biz decisions. Also know this company is very small but booked and I'm currently contract but they want to make me an employee. As a contractor, I've been using my own gear and vehicle for production, with no compensation, which is said to stop if hired on.Here's a basic summary of tasks/roles I've fulfilled in the past few months: copywriting, film director on set, director of photography, video editor, video colorist, video producer, gaffer, animator, photo re-toucher, media planner, graphic designer, designer, art director, film tech/scout.I'm curious on thoughts of pay for this type of role, and how to communicate in this situation without burning bridges or being passive. I have no problem calling out the bs, tactfully of course, and my list is made.

rp0rh4	1640537714	336	Looking for clarity/advice in this crazy job market right nowI live in a MCOL city in the US right now where unemployment rates are pretty low.  I just finished a masters program and have 18 years work experience mostly in small business operations wearing lots of hats.  I’m currently employed at an IT company but the job is not in my field of study, and we have been chronically understaffed for over a year which has really worn down our team and we are entering 2022 with record sales, and a crushing work load.  My boss will probably have a heart attack when I quit. I’m salaried and no bonuses for going beyond expected performance or working 50+ hour weeks and despite COVID we are expected to come to the office.  I got a phone interview with a “dream” employer. It went well but upon follow up they said they went with an internal candidate.  I had another  phone interview in the field I just graduated in where I blazed through the interview process and they already gave me an offer which would represent a 30% pay increase, just not my “dream” company.  New job seems more flexible, 2 days in the office at max (never going 100% back to in office and they said they won’t expect more than 40 hours from me and raved about the work life balance and culture.  It seems like a great fit but the whole process was so fast I don’t know if this is normal?  I’ll probably counter the offer for more since I seem to have all the leverage (they told me I’m the only candidate they are interested in) but are companies really that desperate right now? Or is that a red flag?After spending many years in constant “work burnout” mode I’m looking for more balance to spend time with my family and hobbies but still have decent pay to reach my financial goals for retirement, travel, etc.
roqr6d	1640498536	441	I’m currently in the insurance industry as a “sales” person. I say “sales” because my boss has decided that I need to be one of two go-to customer support people, so that leaves me way less time for sales. But also if I don’t make my sales quotas I’ll get fired 🤷 I’m going to interview for another insurance company soon cause I want to leave the current company I’m at bc I hate doing what’s essentially a customer service job. However, even if I did get a job doing mostly sales with little customer service I think a job where I don’t have to talk on the phone with hundreds of customers a day would better suit me. My first idea was PPC marketing, but this is where the issue starts: I want to progress to a more high paying senior position in the next 5-10 years making at least 90k-100k a year, which is possible for a PPC marketing career…if I have a bachelors degree. I wanted to go to college at 18 but due to circumstances I won’t be getting into I still haven’t been able to go to college. At first my plan was to continue insurance sales and make more money via commissions but if I don’t stay in a sales type of position the number of high paying jobs for marketing or other industries is limited. At least 80% of senior positions I see require a degree. I could either a) go to school part time and work full time, b) go to school full time and work full time, c) work as a freelance PPC specialist while I go to school full time or d) skip college, get an entry level ppc job or get freelance clients and try to get into a more senior position once I have the experience to prove I’m qualified even without a degree. I can’t be working part time bc I got bills to pay. If I study part time I won’t get my degree until at least 30, plus I’ll have to work plus go to class plus study, and my school workload doubles if I study full time. If I try and have my experience speak for itself I save myself tens of thousands of dollars that’d I’d put toward a Roth IRA or 401k and avoid burnout but I risk staying stuck at a low level of my career bc employers care more about whether I crippled myself in debt to get a degree where only a fraction of the classes would apply to my field rather than my skills and experience. What should I do?
robz05	1640447172	111	Are work from home jobs worth it? I'm 27 and have a good management job making 105k a year in a logistics career. I've been fortunate enough to move up fast in a corporate environment. It's stressful though and consumes most of my life. I have a wife and we are working on having kids. Lately I've been feeling some burnout and disinterest in my current job. I can't help but think maybe there's something better out there I can be doing. Are work from home careers more enjoyable and is anybody happy they have made the move to work from home? Also, does anyone have suggestions for work from home jobs?
rmcejs	1640200335	157	Overall, I have been working for about 7 years, 4+ at this current place. My company is great, they handled the pandemic beautifully, I can work from home now and in the future, they pay well, give good raises, I have done various types of projects and have learned a ton from management and my peers, I've been given more responsibility and I can tell they want me to move into management, etc. Basically, it's a diamond in the rough and I wouldn't want to leave them. But I'm feeling my drive begin to weaken and I don't know how to keep going for another few decades without breaking down. I don't think it's a burnout thing because I've worked only 40 hours a week this whole year, plus I just had a 2 week vacation in october/November. Do any of you have tips on how to remain engaged and continuously wanting to learn new things at work?
rlzj66	1640156628	428	Hey all,I've been working at a company since september of this year. It sucks but it is getting better. The pay is good but the *meeting* culture and some colleagues are unbearable. But I can WFH 100% (right now) anyway.When I started, my boss went on holiday and I was left with a colleague that bashed me for every idea I had. Well, I thought it was bashing, he said it was constructive criticism but apologized for it later on. I don't think the guy is bad. I think he has some form of Autism though (maybe I should not assume this).&gt;**Him**: *That's not what I meant.*  &gt;  &gt;**Me**: *But we wrote the criteria down. Everything is in here. Could your elaborate on what you would like to see ?*  &gt;  &gt;**Him**: *The thing I said at the start of this project.*  &gt;  &gt;*bruh.*During those 3 weeks I was completely broken and burst out into tears at home. I decided to apply to another company.I contacted a former schoolmate and hooked me up with his company. The process was rapid. I asked some questions before coming in and they immediately wanted me for a first interview.I nailed their second interview and business case as well. However, I was not certain about the contents of the job. They could also not answer my questions directly;&gt;**Me**: *Do you work with program x to do task y?*  &gt;  &gt;**Company**: *If there is demand from our customers we'll do it.*  &gt;  &gt;*So, is that a yes or a no?*I called with the team lead but I could hear him typing in the background and sounded a bit strict. Also, less WFH. 2 days max.So, at first I gave it some thought but decided that postpone the offer or (temporally) reject it. Also because of some private matters...&gt;my dad is sick, grandma passed away and I had some burnout related symptoms (not too severe).I just wasn't ready to hop into the darkness again. Now, they keep calling me every month if I'm still open for the position. They wanted to talk to me face-to-face again tomorrow. I'm going to have a chat.*For context: There are a lot of positions open in my field. There are more vacancies than there employees. It's a luxury but it also makes it hard to filter the good from the bad. I think the company culture fits me, salary is about the same (not bad), it's a little close too home as well.***Are they too eager to hire me?**

rkqjoa	1640016178	323	Hi all,I am 28y/o and I have been in and out of the job hunt since the pandemic started. I graduated with my master's in May 2020, and have had one job in a kitchen that was a summer seasonal contract. Since then I've had about 40 or so interviews that I made it to the last round and wasn't the one picked, including an offer I couldn't take for a dream job (it involved moving after just moving for my partner's job). Anyways, I received an offer to work in a woodshed near me, and applied because I liked the idea of learning some new skills, working with my hands, not being on a computer. In short, I feel really stuck on whether I should take the job or not because I had a trial day and it didn't go very well from my perspective. I could do the job fine, but the team didn't seem to get along which gave me kind of a bad feeling. I have a lot of skills in graphic design, marketing, and education but after such a grueling job hunt it also feels like I have to take it. I have also listed out some pros and cons:Pros:\-some money/starting to work again\-learning some woodshop and welding skills that I've been interested in learning\-I would get to work with artists, which I love\-not working on a computer\-Not looking for a job&amp;#x200B;Cons:\-Pay is pretty low\-no healthcare (I have a long term health condition)\-long hours/losing some of my personal life\-Team doesn't seem to like each other, signs of burnout\-Long days in a van (making deliveries around NYC metro)\-Doesn't really line up with long term goals\-Less time to self-learn full stack dev (which is what I'm currently working on)\-Physically demanding, and would lose some cycling ability which I love\-steep learning curve&amp;#x200B;I guess it's just hard to gauge whether to take this job, or better to spend my time to keep looking.
rkqhg0	1640016018	288	Hi everyoneI (mid 30s) have been bootstrapping my own small business in wholesale food production for the last 5.5-6 years. I'm severely burnt out and have hit a wall for growth opportunity unless I receive a substantial cash investment. This is my first business and poured my savings into it. It has had significant growth every year, including the Pandie years, but have yet been able to breakthrough and earn a living, other than mostly living invoice to invoice (not so much anymore, but money is still tight). So after a few months of trying to shake this burnout to no avail, I'm making the decision to call it a day.Honestly I'm at a loss as to where to go from here. I'm an Air Force vet with half(ish) my GI bill remaining, with no student loan debt, but some business debts. I have a BS in Sports Medicine, and just the most random assortment of knowledge and skills: I trained as a survival specialist and a weather forecaster in the USAF, and am a classically trained chef with experience in multiple Michelin starred kitchens. I value highly my ability to work hard, troubleshoot, and learn quickly beyond proficiency.As far as my post, I'm looking for careerfield guidance. My goal would be to make over $100k/yr by the time I'm 40. I'm open to trade skills and/or higher ed requirements. I'm trying to create a more flexible schedule (not wanting to work 60+ hours/wk as I've been doing the past 12/13 years), my only issue is that a corporate setting/environment does not work well for me. I'm happy to answer any questions, but for the first time in my life, I'm really at a loss as to what's next.

rk0nee	1639932811	489	 Hello all,I'm (30M) new to the world of Scrum and the agile ways of working, although I have some experience with it. My background education is in HR and I've always been fascinated by learning and development, managerial styles and how to motivate a team and colleagues so effective results and personal growth are realized. In previous jobs, I've had experience facilitating and giving workshops for outplacement, but also people development. Afterwards I've worked as a scuba teacher and recruiter at a tech startup, where I burned out due to the nature of the job and the high expectations.I'ver been working at a national bank since about 2 years in a position that's below my education level, which I accepted because I experienced burnout the year before and the job is structured in a certain way. Since a while, I've thought about entering a different job, preferably within the bank and have been growing my UX interest ever since I left the startup. I've interned at the UX department but unfortunately they didn't have a position there since they hire little to no juniors. I've applied for numerous UX traineeships but that didn't turn out.As I did more courses and talked to more people within the bank, I got asked to apply for the Scrum Master role as they'd think I would make a good fit and they like to give ambitious people chances to grow, as the bank is starting the agile transformation and they're hiring at least 60 (!) new Scrum Masters, and are also looking for starting Scrum Masters. A big bonus point is that the bank knows me, and I've spoken to a lot of people who deal and recruit for the position. I really hadn't thought about this opportunity at all and decided to investigate the role more.As such, I've had numerous conversations with Agile Coaches, Product Owners, the IT recruiter, managers, and other people to enlighten me more in the field of Scrum. The combination between (digital) product development and coaching / team development is what strikes me the most in the position of Scrum Master. I applied for the role, and have my first interview tomorrow.I am excited for the opportunity and to learn more about the expertise, to grow more into coaching and lean more into my HR background whilst having the tech enthusiasm as well - perhaps I could even fulfill a tiny UX role in the team if there isn't a UX Designer.Yet, there are some anxieties: Can I do the job? What if the team is really complex and they think I'm not fit to be a Scrum Master? What if I burnout again? All these questions run through my head, yet at the same time, staying in my current position is not a viable long-term option either.Are these impostering anxieties normal? How do I tackle these tomorrow and perhaps in concurrent interviews?Thanks in advance for any advice!
rgz9xd	1639575419	569	I've been with my current company for almost two years. They have been nothing but great and I have the best manager. However, I never really enjoyed what I was doing here and I expressed it honestly in the past to my manager. I told her I don't see myself doing this long-term.Previously I worked into an entirely different field which I loved, but led me to burnout. So when I joined the current company I wanted to try and make a change. However, in the past 3 my mental health went downhill. I have time when it gets better and times when it gets worse. In the past months, unfortunately, it got really bad. I also started questioning my entire life and why I'm doing something I don't like. After thinking hard about it, I decided to resign (having no plans for the future, I wanted to take a break for my mental health) and my manager was really shocked because it came unexpectedly, since I have good results and everyone is praising me. I was also told a promotion would follow shortly, but I still decided to go ahead with my resignation. One week into my resignation, one of my previous employers reached out to me for an opportunity in the field I worked in before. I had an interview with my former manager and she said she will send me to the next step of the process. I told her that I would really like to come back because I miss working in that field. She asked when I could start and I said January.It should be noted that when I resigned from this previous employer in the past, my manager was very angry with me for leaving and she told me I will fail, so it was unexpected that she even considered me for the position.It took two weeks to hear back from my previous company. Last week they finally reached out and I had to take a test. However, my current manager tried discussing with me and told me she doesn't want to see me go like this. She said they can cancel my resignation, if I want, and I can talk with a career advisor to explore other opportunities within the company. I was completely honest and transparent about being contacted by my former employer and waiting for an answer from the and she was very understanding. She knows I want to return in my former field of work. But because they need to recruit someone else for my role, she needs an answer from me asap. My last day is on Monday. So at this point there is a chance I will be rejected by my former company because I saw that they are actively recruiting for that role. I'm not sure what to do.I told my current manager that she should do what's best for the team and shouldn't wait for me because when I took the decision to resign I took full responsibility for my decision. Also, my bigfest mistake, I think, is that I already told my former manager during the interview that I resigned from my current company.If they do decide to accept me for the role and I accept my current manager's offer (she obviously cares more about me) and reject their, I will likely say goodbye to any future opportunity to work at the former company again.
rgr7ab	1639545015	191	I've been working in EMS for years up to now and I've decided to make a transition to cs about half a year ago. The treatment of healthcare workers in the US and general burnout and compassion fatigue make me lose all passion that I had in this field. I just got called in by my boss because I'm not current in the online training modules that we have to do to stay on top of our licenses. I know for sure that picking up other healthcare-type jobs won't fix that as I've already tried.I still care about the patients, but I don't engage any further than making sure that they feel fine overall. No more friendly conversations, less smiles, I only think about getting them to a better place than where they're at. I'm just curious if there were any other healthcare workers in a similar situation. I guess I'm only doing the minimum to keep from getting fired. I'm excited to be leaving this field, I look forward to coming home and practicing coding every day, hoping to land an internship while I'm in school so I can leave sooner.
rgdumg	1639506547	253	Worked too long for an employer whose business model was to run short-staffed.  I was a manager who wasn't given the resources to run the Dept as it needed to be run.  Replacements for staff who quit were denied or replacement process dragged on for months by senior leadership.  Temporary employees were denied when staff were out for long term FMLA.   Backlogs of work was common as the business had to comply with govt regulated timelines we were starting to miss.  Constant pressure that I wasn't doing enough and that my hard working employees weren't doing enough.I left that job a few months ago.   I was unemployed for a few months.  Tried to work on my mental health and have been seeing a therapist.   I started new job in November.  Much less stress and I don't manage any people.  However I am finding that the slightest bit of pressure or stress is causing me to tune out.   I can't get myself to focus an am avoiding dealing with things.   This is just not who I am or how I have worked for years.   I have been the person who can get things done in the past.   I think my prior employer broke me.   How do you get over the flight or fight reactions when your environment has changed?   I need to work, how did you get over severe burnout?

rfowh7	1639426429	185	TW: talk of suicide. Let me know if this is the wrong place to post this. Thanks!I am 3 years into my computer science career and I have various symptoms that I'm struggling to treat. I find that I think alot about suicide lately. I have extreme difficulties staying focused and interested for the full 8 hours of my work day. I don't find anything very exciting anymore - even hobbies that I used to love.The issue is that theres nothing really wrong with my job. I like the people I work with. Some parts of the job are boring but other parts I find interesting.I've been seeing a counsellor and taking anti-depressants for almost a year now but I'm not what I have considered "healed" enough. This is why I'm wondering if its not just my depression. Does this sound like burnout? Should I consider doing a different career? I have been thinking about asking for a 36 hour week instead of 40h/week - is this too much to ask?I was diagnosed with Autism and ADHD 3 years ago. I am currently 29 years old.
reeilo	1639274796	351	Im a 28 M currently working as a senior frontend dev role. I've been working in software development for 5ish years now and I'm starting to feel like this career ain't for me. Background: I've always been a friendly outgoing person who enjoys assisting/helping people in general. Before starting Uni, I worked at Starbucks and loved serving customers (of course there are the few 'donkey-hole' customers but usually they are managable). When I started Uni, I've always been active in my Club and Society as a committee member. I was even Club President/Chair person for 2 years. Although it was stressful with the load of studying and running events, I always enjoyed it. It wasn't even the accomplishment of running a successful event that got me happy, it was the small interactions I had with people asking for advise or help. Current time: A year ago, I quit one of my dev roles due to burnout and took a "career-break". Just resting myself and doing anything I found interesting. I wanted to take that time and start part timing at a cafe somewhere to get that service line interaction, but due to covid that was not possible/advisable. After 3-4 months of lazing around and relaxing, I decided it was time to jump back into being productive. I went and searched for a job and ended up where I am now, but I'm starting to feel the burnout again. I dont know of its a lasting effect from by previous burnout, but all my development is just giving me stress and no satisfaction. The past few days I've been thinking of quiting the development field, find something that is more customer facing. One worry I have is that in my country (Malaysia), customer facing jobs that are not Sales Agents aren't very well paid. (To give you a perspective, a fresh graduate with a programming degree would usually start of with 3k, but a service line staff would only get 3k if they were also holding a management role like shift manager/assistant manager) Thus I'm stuck between satisfaction and self fulfillment, and income....
re8cai	1639255238	189	I will start my third year of college and I am struggling really hard to find a career path. I have tried coding but I struggled very hard in my intro to programming class. I had a low score in my midterm which was a 40 out of 100. I literally don't know what path to pick next because my GPA is below a 3.0 and I don't know what to do anymore because I can't go to medical school, law school or dental school. Nothing is going well for me. I have $40k in student loans and I have to pay them back. I need something to not only make myself financially stable but to not be stressful to the point of severe burnout or depression. My parents are putting me down since I haven't found a stable job yet and I really want to move out of my toxic parents house. I am currently in NYC with a low wage job. I don't know what else to major in. Any advice? Willing to try anything but blue collar jobs take a toll on my physical and mental health..
re4sn8	1639244748	398	25M in sales management hitting the burnout hard, feel like I’m in line for a promotion but not prepared to wait much longer at my current company.I’ve been a sales manager at my current company (CPG Fortune 500) for 3 years just about. I’ve actually enjoyed it quite a bit, and I was given a lot of responsibility from the start. I manage almost 20 people and have had pretty big success compared to my more experienced peers. I’ve stood out a lot to upper management and have had promising discussions about promotions, even getting a huge interview, beating out 12 other more experienced candidates to get to the final round, but unfortunately I lost that one. I’m also making 75k annually with my bonus and base salary which is pretty good since I live in a more rural area and my expenses are very low. It’s allowed me to save and invest a lot for the future which is nice at my age.But there’s a huge flip side. COVID had thrown this job out of the frying pan into the fire. I am 2-3 employees short and I am expected to pick up all of their slack, early mornings and weekends. I have gone 30 days straight without doing anything but work and sleep a couple times. Even on the weekends I’m not really “off”. The phone rings constantly with angry customers because our supply chain prevents us from getting high demand products in, my employees catch COVID and get put out of action for weeks, forcing me to go do manual labor at all hours of the day, while also being held accountable for my own responsibilities. It’s exhausting mentally and physically. I’m really not confident this will change any time soon, we are struggling to hire people who are worth anything, and we lose a couple employees each month. To make matters worse I got a new boss a couple months ago who micromanages me excessively despite never having had a performance issue. Between the burn out and the boss who constantly micromanages me with basic tasks I have been doing without any errors for years, I am so exhausted.Anybody have any insights? I think I could be close to landing the right promotion when it comes open, but I’m also not willing to sit around and wait for another year while being micromanaged to death.

rdqikt	1639193514	606	Hi there, I'm in Canada and currently working toward going back to school to become a Social Worker. I currently have a BA instead of a BSW so I qualify for health care or social service jobs that don't have the title of Social Worker but most of them don't pay great. I've been applying to jobs like crazy the last two months and its been really hard finding jobs that pay more than minimum wage sine I'm not a Registered Social Worker. Can someone weigh in on which option I should choose? I'm trying to weigh the pros/cons and the "what ifs" and I'm not sure if my burnout is clouding my judgement. I have a conditional offer from a hospital network as a counsellor at their residential detox clinics as long as my references clear next week. This is the first job offer I've received in the last couple months and I'm desperate to leave my current position even though I know the grass isn't always greener. The new position is also one of the only types of hospital jobs I could qualify for so that makes it sort of exciting to be able to get my foot in the door while I'm hopefully going back to school. I have some money saved up for emergencies so I'll be able to pay my rent for the next few months if I can't pick up too many extra shifts at the start or I can also look for a second casual job. The only other thing is I haven't received a contract yet so I need to confirm the salary offer:Option 1: Current Job* Full-Time Contract 38 hrs/weekly (Senior leadership told me the position should become permanent in March so I'm still fairly safe here but miserable.)* No benefits until it becomes permanent (Working for 1.5 years now on contract)* 25 minute commute on the subway* 8 hour shifts * Pay rate $21/hour after taxes* Occasional opportunities for professional development* Manager I like is leaving next month which feels like the nail in the coffin for me not wanting to stay.Option 2: New potential job offer* Part-Time Contract 16hrs weekly guaranteed (There is opportunity to pick up shifts and I was told the program is expanding so there could be opportunities for permanent positions in the near future for 2022)* No benefits* Unionized* 40 minute commute on the subway to the main clinic.* 12 hour shifts* Salary tbd but the posting is showing $20/hour - $25/hour after taxes* Told that there are lots of opportunities for professional development as this is a teaching hospital and they support people working while going to school to upgrade credentials etc. Potential Option 3: Maybe job offer? * Interviewed for a full-time permanent position for a community-outreach program that's also similar pay but in a different sub-category of work.* 8 hour shifts* Benefits tbd * 30 minute commute on the subway.* I would most likely be commuting around the downtown core for outreach which suits me fine. * Do I consider this job if I get an offer?? They said I would get an answer next week but I'm also scared to put all my eggs in this basket and turn down the offer for option 2. Option 4: ??? * Hold out for other job but how long do I take the chance to wait for other offers? What if I turn down this option and its the only chance I get for a while to get my foot into the door at a hospital which is a longterm goal I'm considering.My head is spinning from anxiety and exhaustion...
r8hv0k	1638593357	60	I currently working at a pharmacy and would like to get away from patient care. I am burnout and would like to go back to school and proceed a career in computer science. Also, I tried looking at salaries for and associates in CS but amounts are so broad. I would like to earn more than what I am making (50K).
r7hbwx	1638479196	239	Looking for some advice here on some career frustrations I’m facing.To provide some background I’m a junior web developer with a little under a years experience. I’ve been to school for web dev thinking it would be a great field to earn a living. However since I’ve started work I’m coming to the realization that I don’t like development or programming really in general. I’m frustrated I never know what I’m doing when given a task in regards to programming (I understand this is probably inexperience) and I can’t stand the monotony of coding. It may be burnout but what I do know is that its effecting my mental health at this point.I understand in order to improve my programming knowledge I’d have to spend a significant time studying in my own time, something I have no desire to do.Luckily I have also have an education in Graphic Design (never pursued it after graduating thinking I’d make more in web dev). I realize I’d have to brush up quite a bit on my design skills and build another portfolio, but this is something I can see myself doing in my spare time rather than doing programming exercises.I’m 30 years of age now and apprehensive about a career shift. Does anyone have any experience shifting careers to a field they might have had prior knowledge or schooling in but never pursued?I’m wondering if this is a wise decision to be making.
r6hrui	1638373698	235	I worked at this former employer for several years. It was a good job. Corporate environment. Great team members. Sometimes it was challenging, sometimes fulfilling, sometimes boring—depending on the workload and clients. But I overall enjoyed it and was happy there.I left on good terms. I just wanted to go on to bigger, "better" things with more responsibility. In the past few years, I ended up in nonprofit marketing and leadership positions—and a vicious cycle of burnout. The long hours, high stress, and lack of work/life balance have caught up to me. I want a "good enough" job that allows me to clock in, do something that I'm good at, clock out, and leave work at work. I may have the opportunity to go back to this former employer. I'd get to do something that I know I'm already good at, but can continue to improve. I'd get to be part of a team instead of director. (I don't mind leading in certain aspects, I've found that I don't really like being the one in charge of everything.) I'd also get to work from home—and I am really my best, most focused, most creative, most productive self when working remotely.Have you ever gone back to a former employer? Was it awkward? What did people think? (I probably shouldn't care what they think—but here I am.) I'd be curious to hear some insight and (hopefully) success stories.Thanks!
r647g3	1638326047	279	I am currently in my fourth year as a high school business teacher in Kansas City, Missouri and have started to consider a career outside of teaching in the business or finance field. My reasons are typical for a teacher wanting to switch careers: burnout, bad-to-average pay (\~$60k), and high workload. Another thing is that, if I'm being honest, I just can't see myself working with children for the next 20-25 years. I LOVE the content I teach, especially personal finance, but I feel like I'm wasting that passion on being a teacher. I know I can tough it out now, but will eventually be miserable. I just turned 30 and am having my first kid next year. This has already motivated me to seek a profession I enjoy that has a higher salary and more advancement opportunities.I have a Bachelor's Degree in General Business with a marketing minor from a decent school, a Master's in Sports Management (earned while I was a graduate assistant football coach), and a Master of Arts in Teaching. I can't give a specific career path I would want to take, but have been looking into careers like financial analyst, underwriter, and loan officer. I want to avoid any type of sales as much as possible.I am just seeking any type of advice from people that work in the business/finance world. I know that a general business degree along with zero business-related work experience doesn't initially make me the most attractive candidate. I have been researching online MBA programs in Missouri, where I live.  That seems like a solid next step? What careers right now would be relatively easy or natural to transition to?
r53pir	1638214696	429	Bachelors in business management entrepreneurship.  Global Scholar award.  Advanced programs throughout school.  Even the chosen rep for a leadership program out of over 300 candidates.  I am not a genius, but I have superpowers in my perspective (unbias) and my ability to learn anything super fast.  I can do almost ANY job from data spreadsheets to island survival (and I have).Until recently, I built my own parkour gym for kids and ran it out of a large warehouse.  I think my future career's just harder to find so I'm here at the hive.  Most careers demand almost all your time for lots of money.  I value time most but need money for future family etc.  Give me a task and a deadline, not a 5-day schedule.  I'd rather work 15 days straight to complete a task and get 15 days off than work 22 days throughout the month to complete it later and be told to start picking up someone else's work with no extra pay.  And if it takes me 15 days to complete a 22-day task, I'd like to be paid for a 22-day task.  Is this asking too much?  I work fast and efficieny and often feel punished for it.  I COULD be my own boss, but I just did that.  Covid and some other mishaps... The burnout has been real and I am not up for that again yet.  I wouldn't mind working a stricter schedule, but my list of conditions goes way up: (job recognition with bonuses, a boss that listens, lots of vacation time, insurance...)I could go ANY direction and welcome any advice, but I think to bring focus to this post, let's focus on my superpowers of being an implementor.  Can I become an auditor or business analyst almost overnight if I am REALLY good at it?  Say a company has a bunch of franchises/locations that don't quite follow the same system or see eye to eye with the mother company.  I'd be a great guy to send for fixing that problem and I could do it with almost any company.  I have no idea where to start with that though.  Like I can't call up a company and be like, "i'm a lone stranger with a degree and no formal experience.  Pay me to help you."  I'd get the finger.Please help.  Feel free to ask me questions.  I kept this vague for a brief case, pun intended.
r4no8a	1638160999	208	So for many years I always wanted to be a social worker and help others.  Something appealed to me about helping those with mental illnesses and being able to find their cure, even if it was some form of medication that continued to benefit big pharma.  I found out about the very low pay and consistently high turnover in the field due to the stress and burnout, though I see jobs posted for 25 to 40 per hour almost every day to be a social worker.  Doesn’t negate the stress and burnout part of it though.My parents and my significant other want me to go back to pursuing information technology and coding because of the higher pay.  Not necessarily a loss of the stress and burnout though.  I always said I would go for it and be a software developer, but it never really happened.  I’m now enrolled in a university for a four-year degree, studying Information technology and following that up with a coding bootcamp once I graduate.  Should I have done things differently or decided against the higher pay and went for a career with lower pay anyway?  Also, what’s this mantra about never make your passion your job?
r22ea2	1637863216	316	USA. I’m relatively new to the new (6 months) but been with the company for years. Long story short, I’ve been asked (told) to take on a new scope of work to get the team through the year. Someone put their hand up and said they needed help, and I was the one that was told to take it on. I told my boss originally that I wasn’t comfortable taking the lead on it because I was relatively new, but if they wanted me to support them then I could. They told me that I needed to take it on, but they would support me. I didn’t have a choice. I feel like I’m drowning. My boss is “supporting me” with frequent touch points, but help doesn’t take anything off my plate to tag team together and be more efficient. I’m so confused about the processes, what status the other person left things in, and what I’m supposed to do. We’re working with another team in a different language I don’t speak and there’s translations that need to take place - I’m just overwhelmed. I’ve had countless conversations with various people about this but I’m still just feeling so lost, and I think it’s due to my lack of experience in the role. When I try to ask my boss to take something on (a higher priority deliverable that would be suitable for him to support) he just dances around it, doesn’t commit, and I’m left with it. I’m on a contract with an option to extend next year, but I’m at the point of just wanting to walk away. I don’t have a job lined up but my husband makes good money plus we have ample savings to get by if I don’t find a job for 3-6 months. I’m burnout, frustrated by my current challenges at work and it paralyzes me. What do I do?

r1g6k8	1637790687	227	Hi there! I have been with my current business for almost 4 years, and have been in my current role for 2. I enjoy some aspects of my role, particularly the helping people part. The workload has always been pretty high and constant, but lately it is feeling ridiculously unmanageable. Unfortunately, it feels that everyone is in the same boat, so asking for help isn't going to do much (although I do have supportive colleagues). I have some particularly difficult and demanding stakeholders that take up a lot of time, so also managing them and trying to get my day-to-day work completed, while meeting my targets is feeling harder and harder. I feel like in the last few months the stress has really gotten to me, and has started impacting my mental health, and other factors outside of work. I have less motivation for self care (like going to the gym, or eating well), I am tired (although can't sleep because I keep thinking/dreaming about work), and am snappy or grumpy, which is also impacting my relationship. I did try to do some self-paced online study, but even found this unmanageable as I was so tired from constantly being so stressed at work, and found it difficult to focus. I am currently engaging with a Psychologist and a career counsellor, but would love to hear some other advice.

qyzkqa	1637515079	782	TLDR; severely depressed therapist but job is making me stay 30 days and will report me to my licensing board if I leave before then. I think it will be harmful for both my and my clients if I stay 30 days. Need to take care of myself before I help anyone else. Ethical dilemma.I am a provisionally licensed therapist. Since COVID started in March 2020 have been working in IOP/PHP settings serving children/adolescents. I have been at my current job since April 2021 and last month we started proving in-person services.The place I currently work is very large, corporate facility with multiple locations. I started this role remotely. I have had a horrible experience. During the interview process I was told I would be trained/certified in a specific therapeutic modality. That did not happen and I am facilitating groups in said modality with no training or consult group. I also received limited training for this role in general and it's obvious I was expected to hit the ground running. The first few months I was running 12-14 groups a week. I have been abruptly re-assigned to different sites giving me 2 DAYS to terminate with my clients. I am drowning in documentation and cannot finish anything because they keep piling clients on us. Parents are always frustrated with me because I cannot give their child the care they need because I simply have too many clients. We are understaffed and our site does not have the space to accommodate so many clients. Most are unvaccinated and we cannot even social distance. We were exposed last week.It's been too much. Being a mental heath worker during this pandemic has run me into the ground. The massive influx of clients with extremely complex cases with limited support from my job has been a nightmare. I am severely depressed and burnt out. I have never been this depressed in my life. My identity as well as my close relationships are deteriorating. My partner cannot handle my depression anymore and I can get with that. It sucks. I don't know where the burnout starts and the depression begins. I work closely with my therapist who said I meet criteria for PTSD for what I have dealt with the past 18 months or so.It is EXTREMELY clear that need to leave this job and take care of myself. My clients deserve a therapist who is not struggling with depression and burnout. I absolutely do not want to be around clients in the state I am in. I know I have been "leaking" like locking myself in my office and getting frustrated with staff/management at work. This hasn't been directed to my clients and I need to dip out before it is directed at them.Here's the thing. When I submit my resignation I am required to work 30 days to close out my cases or I will be reported to my licensing board for client abandonment. I do not want to abandon my clients but I sort of am already because I am in this state. I can't take care of myself and find balance when I am working 8-9hrs with a 2hr round trip commute. This isn't going to help my clients. I have seen other therapists with a full caseload get fired and they didn't stay for 30 days to close out cases. They gave me 2 days to close out my cases before the abrupt (and really unprofessional) site reassignment. Is this a manipulation tactic to get workers to stay? Everywhere I have worked with clients I have given 2 weeks. My clinical supervisor said 2 weeks is the norm.I love what I do. I really do love it. I love working with high acuity and complex cases. However the setting I work makes it impossible to do this job well. This job has made me do things against my own vale system. Management cripples us and doesn't support us. They just keep throwing clients at us that are not appropriate for our program but we have to take them anyway. It is so hard to always be "on" and empathetic and compassionate when my company couldn't give two shits about their employees or the clients they serve. It's exhausting and demoralizing.Like I said I have been working closely with my psychologist as well as my psychiatrist. They have offered to write letters for a medical resignation. My pride is getting in the way because I do not want anyone at my job knowing what's going on, although they probably already know. I don't know what to do. I guess I'm looking for advice, support, whatever. It was nice to write all of this out.

Now I'm looking for career ideas potentially related to my interests in fashion, art, design, business, and/or social media.**Being a Chinese American, basically all my life I have had it drilled into my head that being a doctor was the best job out there and that I would make a great doctor. I knew I wanted to be a doctor from a very young age, but I can't really tell if I myself wanted to be one or if because my parents told me I should. I grew up being told that work is for money, hobbies are for enjoyment, and you can't get a two-in-one deal with these. Because of this, I never really considered a career within my interests.I am currently a fifth year student majoring in biology (pre-medical), minoring in chemistry and psychology (graduating next month, yay!!). My coursework has burnt me out pretty bad. Studying for the MCAT, combined with working as a medical scribe and shadowing doctors here and there, eventually led me to the realization earlier this year that I don't think this is the career path for me. The day I decided to stop studying for the MCAT broke me down to tears. I felt like my whole life was a lie and kept thinking of how much time and energy I wasted in such a difficult degree. I told my parents about my decision that night, or rather, they brought it up to me as soon as I said I needed to talk to them about school. They told me to take my time to recover from my burnout and decide what I really want to do. I am grateful that they're so supportive. I know many of my Asian friends can't say the same.Being so close to graduating, I decided to finish off my degree. I know it may not have much relevance to the careers I am interested in so I am open to going back to school, but four years of getting another bachelor's degree sounds a bit dreadful. Perhaps it will be more fun for me when I'm doing something I actually love.I'm mainly here to ask for any sustainable career suggestions that may be fitting for me. I am really into fashion/art/design and business, though I don't have much experience with the latter. I have an Instagram account with a decent following that I share my outfits on for fun (an aspiring influencer, if you will), and I enjoy learning about and being on social media. I started looking at product design degrees today and it looks really interesting to me, but I don't know if going back to school for 4 years will be worth it for this. I would love to hear any ideas related to my interests or even outside of my interests that may be suitable for me (with a pay that my Asian parents won't shame me for, haha). Thanks in advance!
qx1rq0	1637275665	225	I am about to start my third year of college next year and I am struggling very, very hard to find a career path. I have tried different skills such as computer programming skills but it's not for me and I struggled very hard in my intro to programming class. I had a low score in my midterm which was a 30% out of 100. Honestly, I am not a very smart individual as I struggle very hard in logical thinking and I struggle to understand things faster than my peers. I forget things a lot and it's bad to pick things up. I also probably have a really low IQ so that's not a good situation. I literally don't know what path to pick next because my GPA is below a 3.0 and I don't know what to do anymore because I can't go to medical school, law school, or high finance jobs like investment banking. It's like nothing is going well for me. I have $36k in student loans and I have to pay them back I need something to not only make financially stable but to not be too stressful to the point of severe burnout or extreme stress. I don't know what else to major in. Any advice? Willing to try anything but blue collar jobs take a toll on my health...

qv4jrg	1637057094	205	I’m (30F) about to leave my job in journalism to move with my husband to his hometown in the Midwest. I definitely got burned out during the pandemic (longtime anxiety and depression worsened too) but I’ve always had a love/hate relationship with my career. Lots of experience with insecurities, trouble writing, feeling like I’m not good enough and need too much support, feeling like I’m just torturing myself in this career, yada yada. Jobs in journalism are also super competitive now, when places are hiring at all, so itll be hard to keep working in the field even if I decide I want to.  But whenever I start thinking about the career paths I’m drawn to, like counseling/psychology or nonprofit work, I get overwhelmed and convinced that these things would be a bad fit and that I’m not cut out for social services or community work. I’m really counting on gaining some clarity during my upcoming break from work but I’m worried that I’ll be just as confused and frustrated then. I also want to start a family soon, and fantasize about being a stay at home mom for a few years.How did your career thinking change after you quit without another job lined up?

A trail maintainer, a park ranger, a geological surveyor etc. Preferably I'd like to somehow use my auto technical background to find a job with the parks or forest management services. I don't know where to start. It seems every job on USAjobs or similar sites require a college degree of some sort.

qul96f	1636996354	178	Hi, I am in marketing but always did creative stuff aside, however I didn't study It because I was afraid I wouldn't earn as much or wouldn't be creative enough. I have finished my master in marketing and sales and work in marketing now and worked in sales before. Hat kind of a burnout in sales. Took one year of a break and restarted in marketing. It is closer to the creative and that makes me happy sometimesm but I currently I am all in over my head with too many projects and it stresses me out. I feel like I need to quit and do another break, however I know that won't solve my situation.How do I know if the job is making me unhappz and if I would be happier and more motivated in something else? I have a hint it could be connected to doing something more creative, or the fact that I am not building something for myself but for someone else's company. The pay and culture are goodthats not the thing.What would you do?
qu8tox	1636953280	484	I've been working at a McDonald's for just over 3 years, and have been managing there for just over a year. Lately I've been feeling very burnt out. After lots of thinking about it I think my burnout is due to the stress caused by the pace. I know it's a dead end job. I don't feel burnt out about that though because I know it's temporary. What stresses me out about McDonald's is the constant feeling of being overwhelmed with things to do.I hate the feeling of going to the fridge to get some lettuce only to have to turn around halfway there because 3 more orders popped up on the screen and somebody needs my thumbprint, only to run out of lettuce and get more backed up on orders. Yes that's probably bad prioritizing and lack of delegation on my part, but it seems like it's a constant thing there, as we're in a pretty busy part of town. There's lots of warehouse and distribution jobs in my area that have been hiring like crazy and I've seriously been considering applying (specifically a Target distribution center). I'm not very worried about pay, as I get by just fine now and either job is probably temporary; I'm currently getting ready to go to school to study CS, so any job I take is probably isn't permanent unless I work myself into upper management making $50+ an hour.- I'm completely fine with rude and bossy managers- I'm fine with lifting heavy loads and being on my feet 10+ hours a day- I'm fine with it being excessively hot during the summer and cold during winter- I'm fine with being bored all day and doing boring, repetitive tasks- I'm fine working with other people and in teams- I'm fine working 50-60+ hour work weeksThe only thing I'm nervous about switching jobs is the pace related stress. These other things don't really stress me out. I just don't want to feel overwhelmed with tasks like I do at McDonald's.I'd really like to hear from some people who have experience doing both types of work, but I'll  gladly listen to anyone's opinion. What would you recommend I do in this situation? I'm really just trying to minimize stress. I'm not too focused on the difference in pay between potential jobs.The reason I'm considering warehouse work rather than retail or something right now is mostly just curiosity, and because my brother's friend keeps suggesting it to me. The reason I don't ask him is because I expect him to sugar coat everything just so I apply and he can get his referral money. I wanna give it a try, but not if I'm gonna be more stressed than I am now.Tldr: How does the pace between fast food work and warehouse/distribution work differ? Do you find yourself more stressed at the pace of fast food or distribution work?
qt5425	1636822192	439	Hello, I’m a high school junior, and I am currently debating on whether I’d like to pursue Physics or Engineering in the future. My current plan is to be a physics major with a math minor for undergrad and to go to grad school and work as a research physicist or a professor. However, I’m worried about student loan debt, and I’m worried that if I’m not financially able to go to graduate school, then I’ll end up working in a job outside of physics (such as finance) that I will find less meaning in. However, if I’m successful, the prospect of working to solve the underlying questions determining how the world works would feel very meaningful to me! I’m interested in astrophysics, but the only high-level physics experience I have is a quantum computing course I’m taking right now. Regarding Engineering, I’m very interested in Electrical, Computer Hardware, and Aerospace engineering. Engineering appeals to me, since I really enjoy math and technology, as well as providing knowledge to do independent projects at home just for fun, and a lot of creativity. Regarding pay, from the information I’ve gathered, I think that Engineers and Physicists have similar salaries. However, although becoming a physicist (from the little I know about the career) has been my dream career for a few years, and I enjoy academic challenges, I’m very worried about my own ability to succeed. I hear the job market is very competitive, and I’m frightened that I’ll burnout when working in academia, or  won’t be competent enough in physics and then will have to pivot to a career that I’m less satisfied with.I would very much enjoy a career in engineering, especially since through electrical/aerospace I can still work with the physics of electricity and space, which are two of my interests. I often hear that people stuck between physics and engineering should opt for engineering. However, as a high school student, I have very little knowledge of higher level graduate physics, and what either career would look like on a day to day basis. Additionally, I don’t mind programming at all, but I wouldn’t be as satisfied in a career in primarily programming. Also, I am a girl, and there are some gender disparities in STEM, which may affect how my career goes later on.  Also, job security is important to me, since I’m worried about not finding a job/not being able to sustain myself. Finally, to be honest, I’m interested in maintaining a good work-life-balance with a few hours of leisure time a day. Given my circumstances, which is the best option to choose? Thank you!!
qpp6pd	1636411089	67	For the last several months I’ve been under performing at my role, not communicating with volunteers, not staying on top of tasks, and not completing tasks to a good standard. Part of it is the intern we had over the summer required too much oversight, but others reasons include mild depression sapping my confidence and focus, as well mild burnout. How do people deal with something like this?
qo6yjl	1636225570	412	I'm an early 30's male that's currently on disability for mental health reasons; am currently unemployed, not in any education/training, and living with one of my parents. I've lived for many years in a very bad home life with an anti-social narcissist who was psychologically abusive/manipulative and now that they're recently gone, I feel like there's a chance to turn everything around.I am seeking a career path from basically ground zero, other than some prior experience in a couple low-wage retail jobs during my early to mid 20s, which I had to get out of for mental health reasons. I really want to just get off disability and get a sense of purpose in something that won't drain me mentally and leave me feeling major burnout.Some guidelines of what I'm looking for:* I'm open to lots of different career solutions, but I'm more biased towards careers where I can possibly train quicker and get employed quicker. The 4+ years of college path sounds like it could be rather long and while I know it would be worthwhile to landing a dependable career, I'm currently living off of like $900 a month disability and the desire to make a living wage is increasing daily.* Something that fits my personality/temperament so I don't feel completely stuck or burnt out. I'm naturally drawn to stuff that is creative, technical, utilizes my problem-solving/critical thinking skills, and/or novelty. I absolutely hate doing the same thing over-and-over or feeling controlled/stuck. *Personality stuff for those who get it*: INTP 6w5 sx/sp, very high openness, low-mid conscientiousness, very high neuroticism, low-mid extroversion, low-mid agreeableness.* Looking for something that is doable with ADHD/Bipolar that won't make me want to jump out of a high window head-first during the first month. Maybe something that will delay that feeling to the 2nd or 3rd month, or will allow me to safely slip into a bout of alcoholism to numb the pain without any severe social or work-related consequences. Am open to brief stints with ketamine and opiates as well. * Purely technical desk jobs seem soul-crushing, blue collar skilled trades seem like they would make me tap-out early and get severe burnout, repetitive tasks make me absolutely lose my mind, I'm good with computers and can work on them all day, but doing so makes me feel dead inside and I only feel alive if I'm moving around; bonus points for nature. No idea what to make of all that but maybe you do.

The main topics would be: The concept of burnout and it's typesPrevention of burnoutThreating and interventionI would use several exercises especially in the prevention and intervention phases. But I would need some feedback from you. Everything could help. Thank you!
qmnvym	1636041839	253	Hi all! For a long time I have considered moving into a new career field, and lately this desire has been growing immensely. A little about my current situation and qualifications: I am currently a Student Affairs Professional at a very large public flagship institution. I specifically work as a Hall Director, overseeing the safety of 500+ students while also serving heavily in supporting minority students through their college transition. I have worked in this field professionally for two years, did two years of practicum in the field while getting my masters of science in student affairs, as well as student affairs work in undergrad. I have very specific skills in working in diversity, social justice and equity advocacy and teaching (have taught a course on social justice foundations) and that’s where my wheelhouse is. I won’t get into the immense burnout of this field but my big hangup is salary: I make 47k right now, which is relatively high for my role especially considering I get a free on-campus apartment, so don’t have rent. Where I would like to transition my career into is working specifically within diversity, SJ and equity offices at large tech companies. This not only combines two of my passions, but I know the private sector pays handsomely for certain qualifications and in certain roles. Has anyone here transitioned from education to the private sector (especially to tech) and found success? If not, what challenges did you run into as you moved fields? Any advice or thoughts are appreciated!
qmekzd	1636007482	316	TLDR; For the past year or two, i have struggled with productivity, motivation, and drive to get anything done at work. Can’t figure out if it’s mental health related or if I need a career change?A little background: I’m 26f in the mental health/social work field for about 3-4 years now. I only have my Bachelor’s degree in psychology, so my job is mainly to teach coping skills and do social work type tasks to a caseload of about 85-100 clients, all with a mental health diagnosis. It’s a moderately stressful job at a company with a high turnover rate, even for doctors and therapists. Anyways, I have dealt with mental health issues for several years now (mostly anxiety and depression), but lately I’ve felt pretty good. However, in this past year or two, I have had an increasingly difficult time keeping up with productivity at work and I can’t figure out if it’s mental health related or if I just don’t like the type of work I do. I’m at about 30% productivity at work each month, I have 0 motivation to wake up in the mornings when it comes to work (I can wake up for most other things just fine), I sleep half of my work day (remote work) then BS the rest of the day. I’ve already gotten a written warning from work, but not even that gives me any sense of urgency to do anything about it.I’ve talked to a therapist about this and we came to the conclusion that part of the reason I avoid work is because of certain things that cause me anxiety, but even if I have an easy day at work, I have 0 drive to get anything done. I’m perfectly fine doing other things at home or with friends though, so I don’t feel like it’s depression. Burnout maybe? Idk. Anyone else been through something similar?
qlz93w	1635959701	97	What other jobs could I plug this experience into and make over $60k/yr? Currently at 50k and starting to feel burnout. My job currently consists of cleaning and auditing data scraped from websites and tracking anomalies. I use a lot of proprietary/in-house programs. I don't really have any desire to be a programmer, but I can tell a programmer what I need to happen to streamline tasks (have gotten tools designed for my own use before).I do enjoy music, sports, the outdoors, cars, and film so anything involved with those industries/activities could be a nice change of pace.

ql03mm	1635843632	1430	Hello friends, **TLDR**; (more detail below): I'm on the cusp of failing an important ai project that takes about 20-30% of my grade at a T-20 university full-time in-person CS Master's program. Once I fail this, I will probably not do well in the course. As my first semester, I won’t hold the GPA minimum and I'm either going to get kicked out or drop out. I currently work part time and have about 1 year of full time experience in the real world, about 2 and a half years overall including internship. Is this going to impact my job outlook? How should I approach addressing this? Will people look down on me as a college drop out? What do I tell my references who I still see and worked hard on their referrals? How can I pick up the motivation to continue after burning out? I just don't want to disappoint. **I'm truly lost in this field.****Story.**(If you don’t want to read some of this, just skip down to *The Point*for the point of the post.)I come today with a lot of baggage on my back, and I don't know where to leave it.When I picked up programming my sophomore year in college, I was so intrigued. I was interested in all of the applications and success it has been as a profound new tool in human civilization. Space exploration, business, medicine, and everything in between runs some form of software. The world needs optimized, fast, and structured software, as it lives and breathes it.**I had never touched code before college.** I was bad at mathematics, and I was enrolled into another major that I was not interested in. Fast forward a few courses and I competed in the world championship for a well-known tech tournament, met a lot of tech and non-tech people to party with, took an internship role and graduated from a not-big-name state school with a full-time lined up.Nevertheless, I had struggle. I encountered many all nighters. I drank a lot of energy drinks, and took depression, sleep deprivation and the degree paper as my motivation for pushing ahead. I broke up with someone to focus on school and rejected another I found as a wonderful friendship. I told myself that without this paper, I am nothing to show or prove, since my whole experience with programming was in literally just the college timeframe. Before the pandemic, I started to feel burnout of my work. I had to reserve more time for myself, and I did whilst maintaining an internship and full-time school. It became a bit better. The pandemic hit during the end of my senior year, and it was truly influential. I had to switch to working home. My senior projects became much more difficult to work on since communication in the projects wasn’t daily anymore. I was stuck home and I didn’t even like being there since I was with someone else who has threatened my family before. Focusing on schoolwork was not doable, and missing out on real-time talking to classmates, professors, and friends made me feel excluded. I had to sleep late and work hard in my own home, and it was giving me bad memories in the place I felt safe in.**A masters I thought, was not the next path I wanted to take**. I wanted experience in the real world first. Redditors and most cs people I’ve met agree that having a masters is useful if it’s either, a big name school, cheap/free, or for a career specialization. Otherwise, it’s probably not worth it (feel free to correct me here). Therefore, I decided to focus on my work experience, and avoid doing a masters. It’s November, and grad school deadlines are approaching. It’s the pandemic and most schools waived the GRE. I have not worked on applying to schools and have been sitting at home playing video games with friends on my free time to avoid going outside. I started to think about my past. Regrets and anxiety filled my mind as I wondered “what now”. Sehnsucht. 9 to 5 on the daily, come home and sleep. Bug fixing, modernization, documentation. Mundane tasking that was sort of fun to work on, but boring overall. I am grateful for everything I’ve learned, but what about the school things. What about the excitement for new topics. Where did my motivation go? How can I expect a family with no in-person social life? Do I need something new in life?**Maybe a master’s program** *would* **help.**With luck and the hard working will of my recommenders, I was able to catch deadlines, and applied to some prestigious universities. I thought to myself “if I *do* get into a masters program, it should be worth it. Fast forward a few months, and I already had some rejections. During this time, I figured I should also find a new environment to work in. I applied a few times, got two interviews with FAANG, got rejected, and asked to apply again later. (note: I didn’t study that hard tbh, so my fault.) I applied to the company I was interested in a few times, but I got ghosted. I was rejected from all the universities except for one. Expensive, but a T-20. I was surprised I even got in, considering I had a flat 3.0 gpa, and I don’t have any research background. The price tag scared me, and I was hesitant on going because it wasn’t very important after a few years of work experience. Nevertheless, I thought I should take it considering I’m already in. **The point.**The first semester. Only about 2/3rds of the semester in and I’m already struggling. Procrastination for me is an all time high. I’m only at school like twice a week because I’m working around 30 hours/week part-time to pay it off (trying to avoid loans.) I cannot focus at home, and I’m starting to think I have to get a disability test. Every day I come home from work, and I really do not want to start doing anything. I wanted to get into the extracurricular, I wanted to make friends, do some research work. Yet here I am, and I haven’t gotten to even go to academic advisement (I have an appointment in a week). It’s probably too late. I’m probably down in the gutter. My project isn’t even working well and it’s past the deadline. My first exams were average to slightly below average. I need a 3.0 gpa as part of my admittance, but I don’t think I’ll be able to get there. Am I doing this right? Do I drop out? How does research even work?? Will schools in the future wonder about dropping out? I got a few invitations to apply to some good companies, but I really think that’s it’s the brand of the school I’m in that’s doing the work. Will this change? What do I tell my recommenders? How am I supposed to deal with the fact that I dropped out? How can I motivate myself again? I tried looking at some cool CS things but even then, I got ghosted by my dream company and I’m just feeling like shit that my back hurts from sitting in this chair for 4 days with minimal sleep and I can’t even get this project to work. Getting mental help feels like I will get a record on me that will inhibit my chances to get a good job and that would hurt me mentally more than improve. I really want to drop out, but I’m not sure what my goal in life can be at that point. I really want to work hard for this degree so I can work something different, but it’s expensive and I just don’t think I’ll make the class curves.It feels like a waste of time, resources, and excitement. I am lost and I just don’t get it anymore. **(Tech details for the tech enthusiasts)*** I have a lot of experience with Python and C++* Web is cool sometimes, but I mostly like code that works with Physics and real world data.* I have a bunch of books like Pragmatic Programmer, Clean code, and others to read that I either haven’t finished or started. * I suck at math still, and I have trouble with software terminology/methodologies here and there.* I’m more of a visual person than abstract. I take abstract problems and always try to imagine them spatially. * I am good at taking already made things, and making something new, rather than making from scratch.
qk0sqn	1635720956	236	I am an RN looking to transition to the computer science field with intentions of becoming a computer systems analyst. I left the hospital setting last year due to burnout. I've since taken the last year off because I needed time to fix my mental health. I am ready to go back to work so that I can start saving up to obtain a computer science degree. Because my current degree is specific to nursing, I'm having a hard time getting a job that pays decently and is NOT in the hospital setting. I spent most of my savings from nursing paying off my nursing degree debt. At this point in time, I have no debt which is great, but I've dwindled my savings down pretty low and currently have no steady income. I am looking for a job where I can make decent money to save up to make my career move work financially. I live frugally and do not spent unless I have to. I just need a means of decent income so that I can save up to pursue the education needed for a field better suited for me. Any non-nursing related suggestions that pay well? I also have skills in - web design, website building and SEO, photography, and advanced photo editing. Not sure if any of those skills would be applicable to finding a well-paying temporary job, but thought I'd mention them.
qk0s04	1635720884	208	So I work as a software engineer, regular hours of 8:30-4:30 five days a week. I work hard and I basically think I have burnout. I recently started the role a few months ago and got notified that I passed probation a few weeks ago.Thing is, this is not sustainable for me. I seriously don't know how people can work 40+hours a week for the rest of their life. I'm in my late 20s. It's got to the point where I don't do much other than work and come home and it's making me miserable.How do you think my employer will treat my request to go part time? If they don't allow me to I think I will hand in my resignation as I just can't continue doing this. I know it sounds dramatic however I think I have autism and things are really overwhelming for me.Thanks for your advice. I really enjoy solving problems however now I'm just doing the job for the sake of it and think this is as I'm burnt out. The problem with me is its all or nothing. I can't pace myself and I've looked into contracting as it would suit me but I'm not ready to set all that up just yet.
qjlupk	1635671730	229	 Hi everyone.Right now I'm having to choose between 2 different careers and I\`d appreciate any insight/suggestion you could give me.Last  year I found myself in quite a difficult position, having to work a B2B  Sales job with severe burnout. To move away from the position, I  decided to study a Data Analysis bootcamp. Fast forward 6 months I  finished it, and my company offered me a Product Owner position, in  charge of the development of an API, a few internal tools and creating  dashboards for upper management. I took it. I've been working for 6  months in this position, releasing two major products for the company,  but finding at the same time that I don't love the job, as it has been  90% management of the IT team (quite stressful) and barely 10% of  performing analysis, which I love to do.Would  it be better for my career to stick to this PO position or to move to a  Junior Data Analyst job? My thought is that PO feels like jumping  multiple steps in the career ladder at once, and that by jumping to DA  I'll be only delaying the inevitable stepping into management while  earning substantially less money. At the same time, I believe I would  enjoy more a DA position. Any thoughts?

qiqfbu	1635554942	171	Hey everyone! I have an interview in-person with a small engineering firm near where I live. I have had a HUGE reimagining of my life this year as I full blown suffered from burnout at a previous position. It was so  bad just applying to new jobs was making me shake. I now understand that I am the only one who  will watch out for me. I need to make sure this position will respect boundaries and actually  understands what a balance is. What are some of the things I should ask/lookout for?I already asked the manager in the phone interview and he said anything above 40 hours is not the norm. He said sometimes something unexpected will happen and there might be some hours needed but he didn't say "whole weekends" or working until the morning (I have done both at my previous jobs). I have only been in my career for 5 years and I am so nervous to get back into it. Any advice is appreciated!Thanks
qhvv4y	1635453004	317	In my country a lot of the jobs available tend to be in the healthcare industry. Mostly social work, nursing and childcaring jobs are highly requested. So, because of that, I have been trying since high school to get into this field. The problem is that I realized how much I hate these types of jobs too late.I got kicked out of my internships multiple times. I tried working in various facilities, including elementary schools, hospitals, elderly homes and more, and I always permormed poorly due to stress and burnout which caused me to nearly kill myself. During my last internship I had enough of this type job, it wasnt particularly demanding and my coworkers and patients were nice but  dealing with other people's needs for 8 hours a day made me so stressed out I tried to kill myself. My attempt was unsuccessfull but I ended up dropping out of my studies and now I am unemployed.Now I have no idea what to do. I know social work doesnt suit me but its the most requested job here. Simpler jobs (such as cashier, dishwasher, factory worker...) dont give a proper salary and workers often get mistreated/abused.  I dont think I would be any good as a programmer either, and trade schools arent a thing here. I need some sort of career plan, not just a job. My parents are poor and old, very soon I will have to take care of myself completely, and a 400 euros a month job (such as cashier)  isnt going to cut it sadly.I'm not a lazy person. I just made the mistake of spending years of hard work and studies in a field that isnt suited for me....and now I dont know what to do. I can't enlist in the military due to some health problems that are unchangable.I am 25 years old and I live in europe.
qg7sua	1635259055	536	So I recently got let go from my job in tech sales. I was selling data analytics and IT MSP solutions. I have a pretty extensive sales resume with a lot of accomplishments, but I believe that I was suffering from burnout which resulted in my firing. I'm currently in the phase where, after 6 years of sales experience, I'm trying to figure out if I want to do this for the rest of my life or if I want to move into a different role. I've narrowed it down to 2 different positions that I think would be a good transition, but I'm unsure on how to get my foot in the door for these 2 roles. I'm absolutely willing to take a step back, career wise, to gain relevant experience. I'm also lucky enough to be in a position where I'm okay financially for several months before I NEED a new position, so I'm willing to look into certifications/courses/etc.A little background, my professional development focus has always been on sales methodologies, prospecting, and customer interactions. Honestly, I've always been pretty good at it and have always exceeded my quota. However, I'm completely lacking in the technical side of things as my previous company had a reliance on pre-sales solutions engineers to take any somewhat technical question. However, my degree is information technology and by participating in these sales meeting I was able to absorb a lot of information related to data analytics, GCP, BigQuery, and SQL. I certainly couldn't write a SQL query, but due to the fact that I studied SQL in college and have been around it for so long, I believe I could pick up on the basics relatively easy.So, I guess my question boils down to what sort of skills would I need to focus on/develop for these 2 roles?1) Solutions Engineer. I still want to be client facing and interact with customers, but I'm tired of the intense quotas and prospecting/cold calls. I was thinking about looking into a Solutions Engineer role with a data focused company, or something similar. Is this a career choice where you're expected to have a lot of knowledge coming into the role? Or are they looking for more sales people with technical aptitude that they can teach the intricacies? And what should I be studying/getting certified in if this a good fit?2) IT Business Analyst. This speaks to me because, as I mentioned, I enjoy being client facing. I also enjoy problem solving, it was favorite part of sales. Unfortunately, this isn't a role that I've ever interacted with at previous companies and I'm honestly not sure where to get started. Would I have to take an entry level position with a career path leading to this role? Or would I be able to leverage my client-facing sales and problem-solving experience to secure a training path? Sorry for the rambling. Bare with me guys, I'm a little lost right now and trying to figure out how to transition careers and what I'd like to spend my life doing while being unemployed for the first time ever is difficult. I'm having to do a lot of introspection and I'd appreciate any advice you all have.
qfp37a	1635192243	55	I am waiting to finalize a job offer with a new company and will be giving 2 week notice to my current employer this week. I have about 5 days worth of PTO and I am really burnout. Was hoping to take time off the last week of my two weeks. Has anyone done this before?
qfgzk3	1635169230	293	I am looking for some advice in regards to potential career opportunities as I feel more stuck and irritated day by day in my job and am experiencing burnout. Currently, i have a finance post secondary degree and am working as a fund analyst (back office role) within a major bank. To be perfectly honest, I mostly fell into this job. I don't have a passion for it at all but that's been a recurring issue for me as I really don't know what career to pursue. My main dislike is the analytical mathematical component of it and don't want to be in a career crunching numbers for the future.I recently completed the initial project management introductory course as it was recommended to me and found that doable. I'm not averse to jobs with financial analysis components but i'm not seeking positions that are solely focused on that aspect as I find the tasks mind numbing. I do thrive with social interactions as well as i have held sales positions as well. I'm open to IT as well however i am a beginner in terms of coding languages as i have only completed some very introductory (free) courses on python and vba courses as again i am not sure what i can lead to or what career to pursue within the IT sector. I did like credit positions within the finance field during my undergraduate degree as well but i don't know if there is a future in those positions and don't want a job salary predicated on sales.I think my ideal job would be some components of preparing presentations/analysis with a human interaction component as my current position is very back office related and requires hours of work and endless tasks/overtime to complete.

qcvsyw	1634834208	122	Hey career lovelies,I currently work what the outside world considers a dream job. I get to content manage an NHL franchise and from the outside it's great, but on the inside it's never ending weekend work, 16 hour days and the constant promise that tomorrow will be better when I've already been at it for 3 months.How do you know when you're being taken advantage of, and when the 'dream job' is no longer worth the overthrow of work/life balance? Would love any insight and advise as it just feels like I'm on my own little burnout island and don't know how to talk about this with the company or if I should start reevaluating what my ideal job and life should be.

qa4udt	1634496194	735	Hi everyone,I know I am unhappy about my work situation as my motivation to work in B2B marketing is low every morning. I kinda waste time to relax to deal with the stress and to find the energy to do the necessary project management and marketing tasks which I don't really enjoy doing as much as creative marketing tasks. I know this seems very obvious but over the last year's I lost the feeling of what I really enjoy doing, everything feels the same except creative tasks, which is why I just recently started to realize this. I am looking for creatives but also general opinions on the situation and am thankful for the help.I have always been a creative person. Doing lots of sports, music and creative stuff like drawings or using Photoshop, Photography, 3D Animation and Video Editing early next to school. Without doing it for money or any proper education I spent a lot of time within the programs just for fun and out of interest. After school I only had two major options. Either studying design or economics as my grandfather gave me advice. Sadly I don't know my real father but I know he was big in marketing and design, which is why with the "do something that pays and has a future" I felt like doing economics was the better option. My naive hope was to focus on marketing and sales as a major, as it was the only option, to combine this with more creative work in the future. I hoped to be able to do great creative work here. I also chose lots of creative courses wherever I could within my minor of the bachelor to improve my grades as I just barely made it through the economics part of the major of my studies. Wherever possible the whole creative, sales and language based assignments always seemed easier and gave me great marks as I was more motivated.In the last 8 years I started working in marketing and didn't feel like this was I wanted to do. I then started working in an agency where sales was needed. I then worked my way up in sales, more surviving then being the super salesperson, while I am still better in it then a few others. However with time I got more and more depressed. Sales number and hard sales leads made it tough so I just barely finished my marketing and sales master degree next to work.Just recently after my masters degree I collapsed due to health and burnout reasons. I didn't see my self creating any real value and didn't want to do the sales and biz dev rep work anymore and also lost trust in the agencies leadership.One year later I found a great close by employer with way better payment in B2B marketing which was interesting to me because lead generation was the main problem of my ex employer and I was interesting in learning to build a successfully lead generation machine. Not sure if this was better I just knew that I didn't want to work and be measured in sales with targets anymore. I also hoped to have more impact on the creative. While I do banners and posters and little clips now which I genuinely enjoy as long it's not repetitive and the same stupid banner for 20 different products I am still unsure if working even more in a creative field would make me happier or if being employed generally lowers my motivation as I feel like I am not building anything for myself apart from the monthly payment and I also don't feel like becoming a B2B marketing pro.My girlfriend has realized me being less brave in changing my field as we want to create a family soon and I am hesitant to change directions. Do you think the change from sales / B2B marketing into a position like a creative director / art director is possible and do you think I should try it? What skills would be needed and how could I prepare myself for this switch without having a hard pay cut? As I already have agency and marketing experience I feel like it's a possible jump but I am unsure if I can do what's needed just from my personal taste and eye for graphics without any formal education on it.Very thankful for your support, Best, Rob
q9wam2	1634467124	296	I’ve got a good job, my employers are some of the most understanding people I know. I can be open to them about things including my horrid mental health, I get decent health insurance, 401K, yearly raises to match inflation at minimum, bonuses, they pay for a lot of things and also grant us a lot of PTO- almost always accept our PTO requests regardless of the time of year and PTO length. But despite all of this, I think I’m burnt out on them.I’m so nervous I’ll make a bad move and jump ship to another company with the same problems, but horrible management on top of it. I’m a week in on a two week vacation and I’m dreading going back into work. It’s the people we help, it’s the crap we deal with because Microsoft pushes out a bad update and suddenly it’s everyone else’s problem to fix it, I legitimately want to throw something against a wall if someone comes to me mentioning printer issues or texting my personal cell phone rather than putting in a ticket one more freaking time. Already had that happen while I was on vacation but I’ve shut my cell off and will handle it when I come back. I’m not the sole IT person, the world will move on with or without me.My two week vacation was meant to help with my burnout, but I think it’s made me realize how stuck I feel instead. What would you do? I’m so worried about jumping ship to somewhere with horrid management on top of my same issues I deal with at this job- hear about it all the time in the IT workforce- but is it worth attempting when I feel how I currently do at my job?
q9tgex	1634453005	72	 I need some help, I work as a software engineer and I experience emotional burnout every so 6 months. Is it normal or is the workplace overworking me / putting me in tough situations. My Boss is always happy with my growth and performance but keeps giving me more. I want tk get paid more but feel burnout too much lately. Any advice on how to approach this or what to do?

q9f5xa	1634401147	1144	Hi Reddit,Sorry if I ramble in this post, it's a pretty complex decision I have to consider and I am trying to give as much detail as I can think of.**Backstory:** 29 years old, currently "self-employed" by running a small resale business (ebay, tcgplayer, local FB marketplace, craigslist) and walking my moms dogs 5 days a week. I have a B.S. in plant science with about 2 years experience as a research tech/assistant in a plant breeding program when I was a student, and 2 years experience as a cultivator for a medical marijuana grow. I lost that job (fired) last year after I was at the head of an effort to organize labor due to deteriorating work conditions and compensation. Though I was labor side, I was close to the top and personally oversaw a room of 1,920 plants when full, led all projects that went on in that room, kept track of all data, and ran the nutrient/watering schedules. Even before losing my last job I was already feeling as though I was not making enough money, especially for my responsibility level. It would have been barely enough, if at all, to live on my own in my area, and I also went through a few things that kind of put financial security towards the top of my worry list. So this career change was one being thought about even before things went south with my last job. My living situation is also about to change and I'm not totally sure how yet (I won't end up homeless but not sure where I will be or the cost in a few months). I have been living with a grandparent during this time, helping to take care of them, but they just passed away a month ago.**Decision:** I am trying to figure out how to make more money and be financially secure and satisfied, and I am having a hard time figuring out how to do that with my current education and experience. Most horticulture jobs I look up and am qualified for are roughly in the 40k range, whether it is in production or research. I would like to be making at least 50% more than that (with continued growth). I am currently considering 3 new paths forward: 1. The obvious, go to grad school for something plant/environment related. Though it seems obvious it is also ambiguous as to what I would end up doing and feels like a gamble. Also I had a zoom call with a career counselor at my Uni and she said she couldn't really say the grad degree would be more valuable or helpful than an equivalent in years of experience in the field.2. Try and become a PA-C. Going in to the medical field is something I thought about after the pandemic started (I know many are leaving, but I felt inspired). I know I would probably have to take a few pre-reqs and get an entry level job in the medical field to get about 1000 hours of related work experience, but beyond that I don't know how difficult this would be. On the plus side: really good money, they only need a master's degree, less ambiguous than grad school for plant science, and I wouldn't really be forsaking all the years spent towards my bachelor's degree, as I kind of feel like I would be with the next option.3. Go back to community college to become an electrician. My mom and both of my brothers are all in the construction industry (unionized) and even as the most highly educated out of all of us, I enjoyed the least amount of job security and growth. I did a bit of wiring/electrical work when working as a cultivator due to light failures and I don't mind that work, though I'm sure that just one small part of their job. On the plus side, I know I could handle this schooling easily and I could get it done in 2 years for sure. Also I believe knowing electrical work would pair well with knowing how to grow cannabis and might set me up for a consulting/grow construction business of my own, idk just a thought. The cons: since I already have my bachelor's degree, getting federal funding to pay for this degree is not the same, though I'm not totally sure how. And it is a step down education wise.One last additional concern is my mental health situation - I got some reeeally bad senior slide during the last year of my bachelor's degree (and I already took extra time and had low credit loads due to a difficult home life), and then my father passed away right before finals of that year (2017). And it has been a rocky few years since then with some ups and plenty of downs. That is to say I believe I had a real and serious case of mental burnout and since then it has been much harder to think, with the best way I can describe it being like trying to ride a bike with flat tires or walking through mud. Possible, but difficult. I worry that I will get overwhelmed and not be able to complete grad school, should I try. I read about how grad students are one of the most depressed and stressed groups of people and it worries me. I didn't do too bad in school, I think I ended with a 3.39 or 3.49 GPA, but like I said I kind of took the "slow and steady wins the race" approach since my home life was not very stable &amp; supportive.Honestly I have been wrestling with this decision for over a year. I was not in a good place mentally after losing my job (not from being fired really as just being there was becoming a mental health issue, but just from everything going on). Even though I am dealing with another close &amp; recent death in the family I do feel as though I am making progress in getting my head clear. And I would be in a really awesome place I think if I could just figure out this next step for myself. Currently I am trying to set up some informational interviews with people within these 3 fields to maybe give some more insight, some advice on finding these peeps would be cool. I am also enrolled to start the 2 year electrical technologies diploma at a local community college this spring, but that is mostly because there is a waitlist not because I am for sure attending. So I would drop out of that if I decide on another path.Thanks in advance for any advice!tl;dr - Wasn't making enough money so am considering continuing current education in plant science (grad school), switching in to the medical field, or becoming an electrician.
q9dyv8	1634397314	565	This year has served me more ups and downs than the last couple years combined. Oh boy where do I start.* Started and ended what was probably the most mature relationship I've ever been in.* Got a dream job at a fantastic company only to get fired without notice two months later.* Ground through what turned out to be a fruitless dead-end job at another company, even literally moved in there (my lease was up and this seemed like the best solution at that time), then crumbled into a full-on burnout when the company ran into major troubles due to the utterly incompetent leadership.* Felt absolutely overwhelmed by joy and gratitude at certain points, but also sank to the low of teeth-grinding anxiety, self-harm and suicidal thoughts at others.* Went from the peak of my self-esteem and confidence to the bottom of insecurity, hopelessness and despair, pretty much closing myself off to people. Therapy helps but also not really.* Made serious progress mending the relationship with my dysfunctional family only to realize I've been forcing myself into a role I hate all along and start cutting ties with them in the middle of my burnout.* Made the best decision of my life at the worst possible time and adopted a puppy right in the middle of it all. Honestly, if not for Baloo, I doubt I'd still be functioning.Long story short, my life has never been more unstable than now. Fortunately, I'm finally done with the dead-end job, but my boss still owes me four months worth of salary; I need to move out soon, but don't have any savings left for the initial deposit; I haven't had any luck searching for a new job so far plus I've shot myself in the foot by adopting the dog - I can't really leave him unattended for a long time yet, which disqualifies me for a lot of regular jobs including those I'm experienced at (hospitality).**It's a tricky situation, but I've come up with a sort of a plan.** I could take a loan (fortunately my bank account is trustworthy enough) that would serve as a cushion for the next several months, go into maximum savings mode, rent a cheap place and use this time and space to learn. Ideally, I would like to learn skills that would allow me to apply for a junior position in a more fitting, better-paying industry, gradually pay the loan back and take care of myself.It would be a leap of faith, I know. There might be other, less risky options, but this one could propel me the farthest if approached correctly.Obviously, the first thing that comes to mind is IT. Lots of people learn coding by themselves. Not the most enticing option for me personally, but even the pay for an entry-level position is way higher than what I could aim for with my current skills. Then there's graphic design, photo- and videography, which I've always been highly interested in, but it seems like a much more competitive and random field.Surely there's a lot more to choose from. There's online courses, free lectures on youtube, tons of easily accessible stuff. I just don't know what would be optimal to dedicate myself to.What would you do if you were in my shoes? What area would you concentrate on? Any self-taught folks here who managed to land a job they've aimed for?
q8sp5g	1634317326	1336	tldr; I don't hate my current job at all, but was given an appealing offer after a very quick interview process. At the time I had little else on the line, and told them I'd make a decision by this coming Monday. After telling them that, a 4-6 week process for a great job has opened up, and an a highly appealing job was posted internally at my *current* company. I don't really have any "mentor" types and am wondering how to best navigate this without burning any bridges, as every role has serious pluses that I may want to revisit later in my career. I don't know how to handle the self-imposed deadline I gave myself without cheating myself of a more appealing opportunity.Sorry for the long post here, no friends have a similar career, and I come from a lower class American family/neighborhood -- no uncles or moms or dads around that I can really lean on for guidance here. Tell me if there's somewhere else I should post this.**Current Role:** A great "Client Success" type job at a tech company that is not exactly what I'd like to do long term, but is adjacent and lets me run some side projects that are very much in the realm of what I'd like to do long term. I'm in my early 30s, hardly an old geezer, but old enough that I'm worried the longer I wait to pivot my path the harder it will be. Current company has good-to-great pay and *incredible* benefits. The company isn't a true "household name", but it absolutely is within the tech industry. Your barber might not have heard of it, but your College Senior CompSci Niece definitely has. Love the culture, love the people, do feel slightly burnt out at it. Not kicking down the door to get out, but wonder if my time has run its course.So, I started casually looking for jobs. After almost no bites for 2 weeks, I encountered a company that was extremely interested in me, and I absolutely loved talking to everyone there. They offered me a job after about 10 calendar days and 5 rapid fire interviews. At this point, I felt nearly certain I would accept but had some due-diligence left to take care of.\*Also worth noting for later in the story, we've suffered a lot of turnover lately and I suspect my boss and coworkers (whom I like a lot) would suffer a pretty big headache by my leaving\***Offered External Role:** A consultant role that would basically be working with \[Current Role\]'s software, but let me spread my wings a bit beyond that. Big 25% raise in base salary, flashier sounding title, *but* the benefits (while fine-to-good) are worse enough that my takehome pay would only increase about 10-12%. Also the company itself is less of a name than my current job -- 10k+ employees, well known and respected within its industry but not beyond. (Also I'd have 6 fewer days off a year which is fine but obviously not a plus.) Absolutely wonderful impression of the people, and I think I'd *slightly* prefer the day-to-day work.Now where I think I messed up a little and am causing myself polite-boy anxiety, is at the time of this offer I told them I'd have a decision by this Monday 10/18. I meant it at the time, the choice was simple if not easy: stay in my current role or take this new one. Also, I was very much leaning towards accepting despite some misgivings about the benefits and so forth. *Then,* the real champagne problems came when**Prospective External Role** expressed interest. Hugely prestigious, household name tech company. Work sounds fairly compelling and I'd be surrounded by geniuses. Pay would be very good, benefits comparable to the incredible benefits I have right now. Issue is, they just expressed that interest *today* and it is a 6-8 week interview process which I am far from guaranteed to survive. I told \[Offered External Role\] I'd have a decision in 4 days, not 8 weeks. In retrospect that was dumb, but it's where I am.So, I thought "as much angst as it causes me to potentially mislead these incredibly nice people at \[Offered External Role\], I think I will just accept and keep interviewing at \[Prospective External Role\]. Between 2 weeks' notice and the 2 weeks I want to take off between gigs, if I land \[Prospective External Role\] I'll swallow the agonizing bullet of quitting less than a month into \[Offered External Role\]. Everyone will hate me and I will have burned bridges, but it will be worth it for my longterm career.Now, the real complicator came in the form of my current company posting a *very* appealing...**Prospective Internal Role**: all the things I love about \[Current Role\], but doing the day-to-day work I've always wanted. A brand new group of coworkers to help reset my burnout-meter. A significant raise over what I'm making, with no detriment to my benefits. I am far from a lock to get this job, but we are great with internal transfers and the like -- I'd have a great chance. Issue is, again, it would take a *minimum* of 3 weeks to finalize. This job was posted literally yesterday, and seems very exciting to me.Furthermore, not to state the obvious, if I leave \[Current Role\], this is no longer an Internal Position, and I lose any advantage I have over the external applicants. Worse than that, actually -- I'd be an external applicant who quit the company 3 weeks ago haha. So, the "Accept \[Offered Role\] and see what happens with \[Prospective Internal Role\]" approach isn't really an option here the way it is with \[Prospective External Role\] -- if I leave my current role, this role goes with it.**Current Plan of Action:** On Monday 10/18, I *need* to tell my current manager about \[Offered External Role\], \[Prospective Internal Role\], or both. I am currently leaning "both" which feels a little crazy and maybe self-sabotaging. But my thought process is: we're hurting for bandwidth right now. If I say "I have an external offer that I am very seriously considering, but there is an internal position I'd stay for -- I can stay in this role another 2 or 3 months if we can get me into \[Prospective Internal Role\], otherwise I'm out in 2 weeks for \[Offered External Role\]." I'd obviously make it sound less ultimatum-y than that.But I guess, long story short, I am trying to figure out how to make the most of my position without overplaying anything to the point I get left burning bridges in every direction. Preference, from most appealing to least appealing, probably goes1. \[Prospective Internal Role\],2. \[Prospective External Role\],3. \[Offered External Role\]4. \[Current Role\]I'm worried about losing \[Offered External Role\] if I wait much longer than Monday, and then being stuck at \[Current Role\] if none of the prospective play out. Also I do just worry about hurting the feelings/burning the bridges at \[Offered External Role\] where everyone has been so freaking nice and seems genuinely excited by the prospect of my joining.There's also the whole issue that I haven't really negotiated anything extra out of \[Offered External Role\] but that seems like a separate talk.Sorry for the ramble here, again it's a big life decision and it's, overall, a great problem to have. But it's scary not having anyone to talk to about it. I have access to 2 jobs \[Current Role\] and \[Offered External Role\] that I'm very confident I'd like, but 2 jobs I think I'd like more, and am worried I'll only end up using my leverage to break my own arms ha.Anyway that's all, thank you SO much for taking the time to read. This is genuinely stressful but also exciting, so thank you for your help in sorting it out, reddit angels.(edit: I only mention company prestige for resume-building purposes; I personally don't care about the flex, I just care that future employers may)
q8chet	1634257627	148	My previous company furloughed 3/4 of my teammates from April-August of 2020, leaving 3 people to do ALL of the work. We were slammed. They also kindly reduced our salaries by 20% for 2 months. Anyway, when we were finally permitted to start calling folks to come back to work, the higher-ups shifted 4 of my teammates to other departments. Sigh. Their positions were never back-filled. Then someone quit. That role was not even posted. I decided it was time to move on and started a new job at a different company a few weeks ago. I have 0 PTO hours and feel completely run-down some days. Otherwise, I am happy there...everyone is nice and I enjoy what I do. BUT all I can think about is how badly I want a break from working. A 3-day weekend won't cut it.Anyone else feeling/felt this? How are you doing now?
q871ju	1634240169	284	I have been working at a rlly cool Japanese food import company for almost a year now. However, I will be quitting soon. This is due to extreme stress, to the point of near burnout, I got from the commute. I wake up at 6 everyday, leave at 7... I get to work at 9:00. I leave at 17:30..... I get home around 19:30.I knew this beforehand, but I rlly liked the job and tried my best, but enough is enough. Especially w winter around the corner. Discussed it w the boss, it's disappointing but understandable.Now, I've been getting quite a few job offers. These are my current fav options and I'm so conflicted. I rlly know I should be guided by two things: commute and office vibe. but these make it hard for me to decide.1. Turkish shipping company, same pay as now, 8min away cycling, work from 8 to 52. fedex, 200/month extra, 1hr away by metro and bus, work flexible but usually 8:30-5, work from home 2 days a weekI'm just... very conflicted. esp the 2nd offer feels like a difficult situation. I rlly connected w the team during the interview, but the position seems a little bit more intense, commute is 2hrs total per day, but I can work from home 2 days a week. one extra downside is that I'd be getting a contract tru a recruitment agency for the first 6 months, which ain't my preference. however, they rlly wanted me for their team, adding an extra 100/month above my indication and calling back 20min after the interview, bc they didn't wanna risk me taking another position (told them I was interviewing). so yea... I'm super conflicted... help lol
q7ufdp	1634194839	1364	tldr; I don't hate my current job at all, but was given an appealing offer after a very quick interview process.  At the time I had little else on the line, and told them I'd make a decision within 2 weeks.  After telling them that, a 4-6 week process for a great job has opened up, and an a highly appealing job was posted internally at my *current* company.  I don't really have any "mentor" types and am wondering how to best navigate this without burning any bridges, as every role has serious pluses that I may want to revisit later in my career.Sorry for the long post here, again I'm the only tech bro in my friend group, thank god (jk you're all great) and come from a lower class American family/neighborhood -- no uncles or moms or dads around that I can really lean on for guidance here.  Tell me if there's somewhere else I should post this.**Current Role:** A great "Client Success" type job at a tech company that is not exactly what I'd like to do long term, but is adjacent and lets me run some side projects that are very much in the realm of what I'd like to do long term.  I'm in my early 30s, hardly an old geezer, but old enough that I'm worried the longer I wait to pivot my path the harder it will be.  Current company has good-to-great pay and *incredible* benefits.  The company isn't a true "household name", but it absolutely is within the tech industry.  Your barber might not have heard of it, but your College Senior CompSci Niece definitely has.  Love the culture, love the people, do feel slightly burnt out at it.  Not kicking down the door to get out, but wonder if my time has run its course.So, I started casually looking for jobs.  After almost no bites for 2 weeks, I encountered a company that was extremely interested in me, and I absolutely loved talking to everyone there.  They offered me a job after about 10 calendar days and 5 rapid fire interviews.  At this point, I felt nearly certain I would accept but had some due-diligence left to take care of.\*Also worth noting for later in the story, we've suffered a lot of turnover lately and I suspect my boss and coworkers (whom I like a lot) would suffer a pretty big headache by my leaving\***Offered External Role:** A consultant role that would basically be working with \[Current Role\]'s software, but let me spread my wings a bit beyond that.  Big 25% raise in base salary, flashier sounding title, *but* the benefits (while fine-to-good) are worse enough that my takehome pay would only increase about 10-12%.  Also the company itself is less of a name than my current job -- 10k+ employees, well known and respected within its industry but not beyond.  (Also I'd have 6 fewer days off a year which is fine but obviously not a plus.)  Absolutely wonderful impression of the people, and I think I'd *slightly* prefer the day-to-day work.Now where I think I messed up a little and am causing myself polite-boy anxiety, is at the time of this offer I told them I'd have a decision by this Monday 10/18.  I meant it at the time, the choice was simple if not easy: stay in my current role or take this new one.  Also, I was very much leaning towards accepting despite some misgivings about the benefits and so forth.  *Then,* the real champagne problems came when**Prospective External Role** expressed interest.  Hugely prestigious, household name tech company.  Work sounds fairly compelling and I'd be surrounded by geniuses.  Pay would be very good, benefits comparable to the incredible benefits I have right now.  Issue is, they just expressed that interest *today* and it is a 6-8 week interview process which I am far from guaranteed to survive.  I told \[Offered External Role\] I'd have a decision in 4 days, not 8 weeks.  In retrospect that was dumb, but it's where I am.So, I thought "as much angst as it causes me to potentially mislead these incredibly nice people at \[Offered External Role\], I think I will just accept and keep interviewing at \[Prospective External Role\].  Between 2 weeks' notice and the 2 weeks I want to take off between gigs, if I land \[Prospective External Role\] I'll swallow the agonizing bullet of quitting less than a month into \[Offered External Role\].  Everyone will hate me and I will have burned bridges, but it will be worth it for my longterm career.Now, the real complicator came in the form of**Prospective Internal Role**: all the things I love about \[Current Role\], but doing the day-to-day work I've always wanted.  A brand new group of coworkers to help reset my burnout-meter.  A significant raise over what I'm making, with no detriment to my benefits.  I am far from a lock to get this job, but we are great with internal transfers and the like -- I'd have a great chance.  Issue is, again, it would take a *minimum* of 3 weeks to finalize.  This job was posted literally yesterday, and seems very exciting to me.Furthermore, not to state the obvious, if I leave \[Current Role\], this is no longer an Internal Position, and I lose any advantage I have over the external applicants.  Worse than that, actually -- I'd be an external applicant who quit the company 3 weeks ago haha.  So, the "Accept \[Offered Role\] and see what happens with \[Prospective Internal Role\]" approach isn't really an option here the way it is with \[Prospective External Role\] -- if I leave my current role, this role goes with it.**Current Plan of Action:** On Monday 10/18, I *need* to tell my current manager about \[Offered External Role\], \[Prospective Internal Role\], or both.  I am currently leaning "both" which feels a little crazy and maybe self-sabotaging.  But my thought process is: we're hurting for bandwidth right now.  If I say "I have an external offer that I am very seriously considering, but there is an internal position I'd stay for -- I can stay in this role another 2 or 3 months if we can get me into \[Prospective Internal Role\], otherwise I'm out in 2 weeks for \[Offered External Role\]."  I'd obviously make it sound less ultimatum-y than that.But I guess, long story short, I am trying to figure out how to make the most of my position without overplaying anything to the point I get left burning bridges in every direction.  Preference, from most appealing to least appealing, probably goes 1. \[Prospective Internal Role\], 2. \[Prospective External Role\], 3. \[Offered External Role\]4. \[Current Role\]I'm worried about losing \[Offered External Role\] if I wait much longer than Monday, and then being stuck at \[Current Role\] if none of the prospective play out.

q6qe3o	1634057214	510	My apologies if this is too long or the wrong sub. I’d be delighted to be pointed in the right direction either way. I worked in mental health with my undergrad for almost 10 years until December 2020. Burnout from the crappy company I worked for and some issues in my personal life hit me hard and I needed a change. I decided on a career change that really excited me…the workload can be a lot but the pay is eventually worth it and hours really flexible so that I can have an appropriate work/life balance and be home with my kids most of the time, something I had been lacking. So in December I quit my job with the intention of taking a few months to complete the education requirements and find a mentor for my training hours. Then I found out I was pregnant with our second child.This past year has had a lot of ups and downs, we had a move and a medical scare with our daughter, plus getting married and actually having our second baby. Long story short I’ve been slowly working on my classes but haven’t finished them yet. I don’t know when I will with a baby, plus I then have to test and find someone to train me and it will be at least a year if not longer before I start making decent money. I have never really had a specific “dream career”…I fell into MH after college and stuck with it because it paid the bills and I didn’t have any idea of what I would do otherwise. I would gladly stay a SAHM as my husband makes enough money to support our household but there’s a few issues. We’ve been renovating the house we moved into and depleted our savings to do so and my husband also wants a career change but can’t really do that if I don’t have a reliable income. I’m also tired of not having my own income to contribute to the family. I really just need to be bringing in some money in the near future.But I don’t know where to go from here. I want my husband to be able to figure out his next path and I want to feel more secure financially. Going back to an office setting isn’t an ideal option at this point because of childcare costs. I want something that I can do at home so that I can keep our son out of daycare a bit longer and still have some time for my studies because I don’t want to just completely abandon that path for myself either unless I find something else that is equally financially beneficial and allows me to be present at home.I have years of management and documentation experience and could easily go back to MH and work remotely but I don’t want to get sucked back in and risk my own MH. I have no experience in anything else and don’t really know what kind of WFH job I should be looking for.
q6obek	1634051407	467	I love my job. For the past two years, I wholeheartedly meant that statement, and now it feels more like I’m telling myself. The past 4 months have been horrible. We had an audit that left one of our professional licenses on the line and I worked 21 straight 18 hour days to prepare. The rest of management felt it was solely my job, even though everyone would have been able to help. It was daunting. My boss had so much faith in me that he took a vacation during audit prep. (He also owns the company). This is where the burnout started. I am the office manager but also the only person who does my role. I am AR/AP, compliance, HR, I do all of the backend sales paperwork (and we sell cars so it’s a lot), business development (for example, we are buying a property and I am the one scheduling surveys and doing the logistics and when we bring on a new lender, I do the paperwork for that too) and pretty much oversee the day to day. I have a part time assistant who comes in 18 hours a week and it helps but it isn’t enough. I regularly bring home an hour or more of paperwork nightly. We have doubled our production this year, which is great, but it has increased my workload tremendously. My day to day has no rhyme or reason, I am simply making it through the day. My job is literally never done. As we grow, my boss has been reading motivational books and he is annoying the crap out of me. He will say things like “The book says to just fire people who don’t want to be here and worry about the unemployment claims as they come.” And I was like “You literally pay me to protect us, but sure.” Or “I don’t need problems, I need solution finders.” I can’t bring myself to buy into his motivational take- it - as- it- comes nonsense right now. I’m exhausted. My brain is exhausted. I’m unhappy coming in in the mornings. People with far less workload make 3x what I do (that’s the curse of doing payroll. Knowing what everyone makes) and it leaves me feeling bitter towards them because they get to come in, have a good time and drink the koolaid, while I sit here, drowning in work. I feel like screaming at him that his motivational speeches aren’t helping me at all, but I am afraid to tell him that I am drowning because he is so “motivated” and wants “solutions and not problems”. He was my only friend at work due to the nature of my role, and now that I don’t even want to talk to him, it has made work even crappier.

My current company I started off in HR, but was asked to transition into a customer service management role about 1.5 years ago. I enjoyed it at first, but the lack of empathy and kindness has dwindled and causing severe stress and burnout. Debating going back into HR or to transition into something completely different- project management or operations management. Is a complete career change a disaster waiting to happen or will it allow me the happiness I desire in my work?

q4cgz4	1633746803	232	Due to my own mental health concerns, managing stress has been near impossible. The cumulative impact of a few years of dealing with it, plus the endless demands of my line of work, have driven me to burnout. I help run a drop-in center. Most of the people we deal with are homeless. It's unpredictable and chaotic from day to day, and given that i struggle with such environments to begin with, a few years of doing it has worn me way out.I began having panic attacks every morning before work. Then i began getting irritable at my clients. Then the irritability turned to outright anger. One day i exploded in epic fashion. I started throwing shit, yelling, and cussing. Stormed out of the office. Now im on leave while i figure things out. I am so embarassed and ashamed. With each passing day away from work i feel better. The thought of going back creates a feeling of anxiety and dread.My boss doesnt want to fire me because i do great work; i am normally very, very good at what i do. I just dont know what to do. My own mental health issues (content for different subreddit) coupled with the stress of the job have just worn me to a nub. I have nothing left, and i am so unhappy with life.Idk. Any words of advice or wisdom would be great.

q2c3p8	1633490601	667	TL;DR - **I have four years executive-level experience in the nonprofit sector, but no formal education of any kind for anything I currently do. I am at the point of mental health crisis burnout and need to find a new job. Do I stay in the field, or look elsewhere?**&amp;#x200B;In 2018 I started a job as a shelter assistant at a nonprofit targeting youth homelessness. Their marketing director was leaving, so I offered to help upkeep of the social media account as a way to supplement my part-time hours. Within a few months I was offered the Marketing Director position (with no experience beyond managing social media accounts of previous jobs) which quickly expanded into the Executive Assistant role. It was a smaller nonprofit that had a lot of issues, but I enjoyed the work and was good at what I did.In 2020 we were acquired by a larger nonprofit and I had to re-interview. I ended up landing on the philanthropy team in a new position that did not have **any** written responsibilities or guidelines. This was a new position intended to be 'flexing' and 'adaptive', but I didn't actually have any insight on what I was doing until about 6mo in when I was tasked with leading virtual events. I taught myself the Zoom and MS Teams platforms, learned basic video editing and audio mixing, and expanded on my knowledge of scripting, event management, and marketing. I was in a good spot with this role for another 6mo until my boss quit due to stress and I was asked to begin passing events off to another team. That was halted when a last minute campaign was planned and they needed support, and I continued for another few months before they asked me to pass it off again. Rinse, repeat. Add in another two bosses quitting due to stress as well as a number of coworkers, in addition to ongoing C19 layoffs and limited rehires. Meanwhile my other duties have increased. I am now in a pseudo-marketing role, but also supporting equity and justice work, and still part of the philanthropy team as well. Recently my closest coworker quit 'unexpectedly' and her event planning lead role fell to me as well.   During all this I have not seen any increase in pay, have had no onboarding or training of any kind since I began, and have yet to have an updated job title or description.   The breaking point was the recent death of five family members in quick succession, and my request for some scattered PTO across the 4th quarter. I was asked how I will be responding to emails while attending funerals and family gatherings, and told not-so-subtly that my PTO request was inconsiderate and 'poor timing' due to how busy we are. I've begun having full on panic attacks and dread logging on each day, but as the primary income for my family I feel at a loss. I know my qualifications are limited - I dropped out of school at 15 and have never had any formal training of any kind, compared to my Masters-level coworkers - and I know I got very lucky landing this role to begin with. My fear is that my skills wont be up to snuff at places specializing in any one thing, or that I will have to take a significant pay cut to transition and put my family at risk. My partner is disabled and their limited income will not be enough to pay our rent should I be out of work even for a few weeks.   What should I do? I don't think I have it in me to continue much longer in this industry, given how the 'many hats' structure is so commonplace. What's worse is that I'm up for a 30 Under 30 award in a few months and feel ashamed to quit before / immediately after receiving it after some great coworkers worked to get me nominated.

q2956n	1633479426	512	Hi everyone,This is long, sorry.This has been an incredibly tough year. I left an old job in October of 2020. That job had already been making me show signs of burnout (increase drinking, sleep problems, anxiety sitting in front of the computer) and not to mention i destroyed my knees and wrists (PT and acupuncture helped) due to having a horrible ergonomic setup after being sent home for covid. I was 25 at the time and had no idea ergonomics mattered because my body just always dealt with it -- now I know it matters A LOT.I left that job to join a start up company because I was curious what a smaller, quick to grow environment would be like. It was easily the worst decision of my life. I had a mental breakdown after three months and have been on disability since February 2021. It definitely felt like a low that I hit. However, I have grown a ton. I have reestablished priorities in my life. My career used to be my number 1 driver but now I know it's not what defines me. My partner is the most important thing to me along with my wonderful dog and apartment I love.My old employer reached out to me and wants to hire me back. The offer came with a 22% pay increase from when I left a year ago and a signing bonus. One issue is we moved for the start up position so now my commute is 3 hours. That is highly unreasonable but I would be able to WFH two days each week. I can't negotiate for more time because the company does not have a specific path forward yet (everyone is still WFH full time right now) but I do think I could work it out to have more WFH once plans are set in motion to return on site. If they are against me having more WFH i can always just quit.What I want advice on is this feeling of dread I have now that I am transitioning back into a career. It does not feel like the normal nerves of going back to work. It feels like a horrible dread and gnawing on my insides. I was completely mentally destroyed in February. I don't say that for hyperbolic effect. I had a rough childhood and have PTSD from multiple events. The work experience in February brought up so many demons I never wanted to think of again. I am worried I am no longer fit for capitalism. Am I broken? Is this what I am now? A blob of anxiety whenever I think about returning to work? I have all the mental health support (therapist and psychiatrist). I don't know what the answer is. I worked so hard for where I am. Bachelor's and Master's, ignoring my health for years. I won't do that anymore.Any advice/help is appreciated. If you relate at all to this please tell me so I know I am not alone. It is so hard to not feel like I am a failure.Thanks

q156xo	1633353242	247	I am an upper manager and a major decisionmaker in my department. I have my own team that I have built myself when I came on board. I’m at an exciting, growing company (Our team doubled during the pandemic). I got promoted a year ago, and I get raises every performance cycle. I am very fairly paid, plus some and I have great independence and flexibility. The only difference now is that my boss has taken on additional workloads and he often doesn’t have time to be my boss (don’t regularly meet, I don’t get feedback, he seems checked out).I can’t shake the constant feeling of burnout. There are a lot of tasks I do that I have outgrown in my position, but would need to hire a new person to take that on and I’ve been denied a new hire “for now.” The thought of doing those outgrown things every day is daunting for me. I procrastinate doing them and thinking about them almost makes me dread signing on for the work day. But when I write out my pros and cons list of the job, the pros far outweigh the cons. Plus, I’m super happy when I do get to work on the things my position actually calls me to do. I know I don’t want to quit this job, I really enjoy most of it. But the little things that make me feel burnout are hard for me to shake. How can I combat this?
q12s4g	1633343524	366	I recently went back to the office after being remote since COVID. For about 2+ years I've been  overworked to the point of burnout. I've stopped trying since management is turning a blind eye to the fact that I and others need help and i now know there is no hope for it. Everyone is miserable and I hear of good ppl leaving weekly, which is going to make my job even harder. Working from home made it tolerable and I wasn't sucked into the negative environment which is distracting from my work. I've made the decision to quit for some time...but I'm afraid to go thru with it...to actually have the conversation with my boss. My husband has a good job and we have savings to carry us through. I keep flip-flopping on offering to do parts of my job as a consultant working from home. That is what I did before working here full time.Mgmt has been angry about the people leaving, like they are traitors. So I don't know if it's even worth it to offer consulting,...but they are so short-staffed and only 1 person per role with no backups. I can time it on the heels of my coworker putting in her resignation to use that as leverage (but not say that of course).So two questions:1. Do you think it's worth it to discuss consulting with a company that has turned toxic? My boss is not an unreasonable guy...but I've only worked with him for 6 mos so who knows how he'll react. 2. How do I actually quit? My manager is located in a different office. I HATE confrontation and delivering bad news so much. Do I set up a meeting? Do I tell him during one of our long one-on-one mtgs when we work on a project? Do I send an email with the letter?This is torture for me and I keep flip-flopping about the decision the consulting part because every time I meet with my boss, he's friendly and nice...but deep down narcissistic and says the things I want to hear. Sometimes I feel like it's an act and I'm a big joke for falling for it. Any advice?
pxco8b	1632853937	232	i have an interview this thursday to become a technical recruiter and this is currently all i can think about …i earned my degree two years ago and due to covid/general life things, i never entered corporate america. I feel like I’m being forced out of the service industry because I can’t afford it anymore. i’ve always felt like I wasn’t a 8-5 person and was hoping to avoid any job with that kind of scheduling, but now I don’t think it’s avoidable. if there’s ANYTHING, i could truly see myself doing full time, it’s event planning, but it’s been so hard to find/land an opportunity. so i’ve opened up my search a bit. sure, recruiting wasn’t what i originally had in mind, but is a job a job at this point??my main questions - feel free to respond to any or all of them 1. do any entry level jobs prioritize taking care of yourself and work life balance? are they all about grinding until you’re established in your career? do they all produce burnout?2. if you’re not a morning person, how can you adjust to 8-5? what makes it doable?3. would you accept a job that didn’t offer PTO the first year?4. if you work in recruiting do you suggest it to other people? (i understand it’s sales, to me everything seems the same) 5. is anyone hiring in atlanta lol
pw6j0x	1632704884	182	I’m originally from New York City. I’ve been living in Philadelphia for approximately 4 years. I’ve been wanting to move back to New York City mainly to be close to my mother again.My current job is pretty nice in that I work four days a week and have summers off. I essentially work around 7 months a year. The salary is good for PA and I get by OK. I recently applied to a job in NYC and got an offer. It’s 26,000 more but the job is 12 months a year (although 24 vacation days, which is nice). It’s also significantly more intense. It will be challenging which I’m kind of looking for but potentially may lead to burnout in a way my current job doesn’t. I’m unsure what to do and feel 50/50.If I move to NYC I can be closer to my mom but will have a more stressful life. It should be noted that I spent a lot of time with her during my vacation time. The other thing is the NYC job is at a prestigious institution. Thoughts?
pun9x5	1632500657	178	I have worked my behind off in my first job since college during the last two years and in return I got overlooked for a promotion. I had to beg for a pay rise which they have still not delivered on because well the job is reward enough or some nonsense.There are a lot of things that are unfair in my current job which I won’t go into but it’s generally an unfair place to work. All of these things combined with being overlooked has made me feel embarrassed and stupid. I literally dread going in even before the weekend ends. I hate sitting in the office. I hate everything. I have reached a point of misery and anguish. Simultaneously, I cannot be out of work now. I’m not sure what to say but I think I’m completely burned out. I spent the whole day over the wknd in bed crying on and off. I really don’t know what’s wrong with me. I didn’t know why I was crying. This is not even what I went to university for.
psj7pg	1632232518	109	I’ve been at the same company for five years.  8 months ago I got a pretty big promotion which I thought would help with the burnout, but I’m just so over it.  The catch?

I have flexible hours, I work from home, accumulated time off, flexibility to care for my kids, etc.  But I’m not fan of my new boss and feel like I do less meaningful work now.  I keep looking at other companies but I’m wondering if I’m being crazy? I’ve got a pretty ok gig now, I just don’t love it.Thoughts?
psa46h	1632193524	181	Background: I work as a data analyst in a large company. They pay well but after working for 2 years, the politics and the monotonous and Kafkaesque work life is just too much for me. I always dread having to work every week and I feel depressed and anxious during my off days. Nothing makes sense anymore on what I do. My gut obviously tells me to leave but the pay at my current job is simply too high to ignore and I fear that I might not get the same pay in other companies where I’m at.There’s also this nagging feeling that I should shift my career to data engineering. I always enjoy the technical data work that comes with my work more than the analysis itself and would love to jump ship to such role but I am afraid that this might regress my income source.This is currently my dilemma right now. Should I leave, take a break and recoup, and find another opportunity that fits what I want to do as my job? Even if it means earning less?
prog6n	1632115875	333	As title states, should I tell my boss I'm suffering from imposter syndrome? I'm not sure if it's that or if I really am just inexperienced. I've never been so stressed about a job in my entire life. Sometimes I wonder if they actually know what experience I have based on the tasks they give me, and also if/when I ask questions sometimes their answers go over my head OR everything feels rushed because everyone is busy and I feel like they don't have time to help me. (No I didn't lie on resume or in interview or anything like that to give the wrong impression). I'm scared that if I ask "dumb" questions they're gonna look at me crazy and fire me (someone else was literally let go for not being as experienced as they initially thought). Also, I honestly just don't like looking dumb. I know that's my own issue to deal with though. I just wonder if I bring this up to my boss what kind of image she is going to have of me moving forward, and if it'll end up hurting me instead of helping. She has stated that they know what experience I have and that they're there if I need help but sometimes I doubt that they REALLY know. Been in the position almost 1 year and still feeling like this. I keep telling myself that eventually this feeling will fade away and in the end it'll be worth it and I'll have gained all this great experience, but for days or weeks at a time all I think about is quitting and that I'm on the fast track to burnout. The fact that I receive compliments on my work and just a few other things that I've noticed (i.e. how they fired someone for inexperience but haven't fired me, I haven't gotten any complaints etc) makes me think that maybe this is imposter syndrome and not lack of experience per se. I would appreciate any advice!!!
pqxkhd	1632010298	902	Most of this explanation is just me venting; for the question itself, skip to the TL;DR. I'm 19 and have pretty limited job experience; in addition to some volunteer work managing donations for refugees and doing other service projects here and there throughout high school, I worked on my college campus as a food supplies delivery driver (2 months, until they let me go because we were overstaffed) and later as a front counter worker at the campus Chick-fil-A (about 4 months, to the end of the academic year). I worked only about 15 hrs a week for both jobs. While they were each challenging and somewhat stressful in their own right, they feel like nothing compared to my current job, which is...customer service. It's a remote position; not even full time - I work about 28 hours per week for an online food delivery company. While other agents specialize in taking orders over the phone (for customers who are elderly or have trouble with placing orders online for whatever reason), I am on the existing order phone line. Sometimes customers will call in to this line with general product or shopping questions--or requests to edit the details of an existing order--but most often they are calling in about a delivery issue (e.g. the product was damaged in transit or there was a UPS/Fedex delay that caused spoilage). Most cases are those involving third party errors like this, for which our company does not typically offer full refunds (noted in our policy), but instead offers to reship the product or provide a full credit to the customer's account to use toward another order. I think these resolutions are fair and reasonable, but of course, some people are never satisfied. Many people place these orders for special events and are unfortunate to become part of the 1% for whom something about the delivery goes awry.The point is that things can become very ugly, and I am frequently placed in an awkward position as the messenger between a manager and dissatisfied customer. Much of the time, I feel like half my job is to serve as a therapist, or to grovel before customers with repeated apologies and acknowledgements of 'how awful' we are as a company. But I guess that's just customer service.I've been working since the start of June, and am lucky to know that I will be heading into a new position in a completely unrelated field of work, far away from any crabby customers in mid-October. However, I told my boss about a week ago that I wouldn't have to leave until Sep 30th, so they're expecting me to work until then.I guess some kind of switch flipped in my brain at the start of this past week and this work has suddenly started to feel unbearable. I've always been prone to social anxiety and been pretty introverted, though I know how to talk to people when I need to. Even positive interactions with customers in my job stress me out, though the negative interactions have become so frequent that my mind has started to go blank in these cases and I feel less and less strength to put up a fight with the customer about our company's policies and the resolutions we can provide. I almost feel viscerally ill whenever I hear the phone ring now. The company is nice and my coworkers are cool but the work environment is just really getting to me - sometimes I border on panic attacks and tear up right in the middle of calls.I began doing this job in early June. Honestly most of the specs for it are pretty much opposite to my strengths and range of soft skills (I am very sensitive, absolutely hate confrontation, and get really anxious if I don't please people) but I thought it would be a good form of exposure therapy, and it would teach me a lot. Frankly I'm still surprised they accepted my application. Was I foolish to take it? Probably; but I didn't really have other options at the time. I really needed the money, and my family has been traveling, and so I needed a remote position that didn't require a college degree or some other strict qualifications. And there are many aspects of it that have been good for me. But I am experiencing the worst burnout I've ever had in my life; more than any moment in school or as a competitive long distance runner.Thus, I need to quit, or at least dramatically reduce my hours for the remaining two weeks. I haven't been very open (like at all) to my boss about my anxiety and the stress this job has caused yet. By some miracle, I have had perfect attendance and some other managers have given good feedback about me to my boss. I just really worry, because I know we're a little understaffed atm and I don't want to hurt my future job prospects by quitting without advance notice (though I know I will never go back to customer service). How do I best inform my boss? Pretty much all company comms take place over text or email.**TL;DR I told my boss I'm going to quit my job in two weeks but suddenly hit a wall, and thinking about doing another shift makes me sick. How do I explain to her I'm quitting now in the most professional/graceful way?**

pq3i20	1631896143	422	So I'm in quite a situation. I started working in tech when I turned 16 and have worked ever since. I'm now 25 years old and have continued working all these years, getting into an university and doing my bachelors in 5 years, because I've also worked full-time for most of the time. My grades are 3/5 and I got a 2/5 for my bachelors thesis, so there have been clearly some compromises as I know I could do a lot better.I like my co-workers, but otherwise working as a senior software developer is just really not for me. Doing 40hrs of that + 10-30hrs of university per week for what feels like an eternity has left me as husk of myself. I am building wealth, have everything in place etc. everyone thinks I'm happy, but in reality I cannot get up from the bed at mornings. Usually I wake up whenever and make sure my phone is on, so that if someone messages me I can react like I was already online. I'm pretty sure covid remote work world has saved me in a sense, but in the meantime has also meant I've dived deeper into the abyss.I know I like tech, R&amp;D and creating new concepts, but would rather work as a project manager, scrum master etc. part tech part people position.I have a fully free position at a CS Masters program in a highly regarded university where instead of paying for it, I actually get 650€/month allowance and have an option to also take 600€ of 0.25% interest student loan. I could live with that. I'm thinking about quitting my job to focus on my studies, as doing okay/barely passing in courses really bothers me and am thinking about using the 1-2 years of studying as a chance to scout out and jump into the roles I want, trying to dodge ending up as a software developer once again. Doing masters would give me the perfect cover and the only price I pay is the opportunity cost of not working.I'm pretty sure I'm going to do this, but would appreciate some ideas, feedback or notes. I know I can't return to work, I'm just so done with it.I know my GF likes the expensive things I can afford and I couldn't participate in every craft beer tour on the planet, but those have stopped giving me joy years ago. I need to figure what I ACTUALLY want to do and getting masters is somewhat of a personal goal for me.

pp4r88	1631760130	282	I'm currently deciding between continuing to work in horticulture or going back to school for a master's degree in counseling to become an MFT. I'm equally drawn to both in terms of my level of interest. For each one I've written out some of the pros and cons that I perceive, but I'd love to hear from an outside perspective. You might be the tipping point in helping me decide!Pros of horticulture: plants are cool, get to work outside, often work independently with lots of time to think, low-stress, wouldn't need to go back to school (though educating oneself about the field is helpful, of course), get tons of exercise throughout the day, plants are coolCons of horticulture: pay is low in most roles, working outside in the elements can be physically taxing, can feel a little dull at times when working solo, potential exposure to pesticides/herbicides, potential for injuries when using certain machineryPros of counseling: have volunteering experience in it and have found that it's something I have a natural facility for, could eventually earn decent pay if I moved to doing private practice after becoming licensed, could work indoors in a more climate-controlled setting, fulfilling work, very mentally stimulatingCons of counseling: getting a master's degree would be expensive and I wouldn't be earning very much money immediately after graduation, can be pretty sedentary depending on the setting, can be very emotionally draining and burnout isn't uncommonI've spent a lot of time debating internally and have lost perspective. So I'd love to hear some fresh opinions and find out if, to a casual reader, one or the other seems like an obviously better fit based on what I wrote. Thanks for reading!
pn82zn	1631506100	98	I am seeking advice. I am experiencing extreme career burnout. For context, I have been a teacher (K to University level) for about a decade now, and I’m in my early thirties since I started working straight out of school.I speak 4 languages, hold a Masters degree in education, and have a background in fine arts. I am the most productive, creative, and at my happiest when I can be left to work alone in quiet environments.Is there anyone out there with similar qualifications and/or personality, who has found fulfillment and happiness in a career change? Thanks in advance.
pm08jt	1631332750	102	I am a BBA student, I am Prety confused about what kind of job best fits me.I will like to say a little about myself. I am all about ideas and problem solving, I do have good psychology knowledge by reading books and by watching video lectures I am a good listener, I can create a good working environment I can also deal with customers, I can motivate people without burnout I can also good at solving people's problems, I can also take a matured decision. but I am not good at writing but the good thing is I am working on it.
plbm5d	1631238881	204	I'm looking for a career change, and I was thinking about going into massage therapy. I'm in my mid 20s, currently working as a behavior analyst (BCBA). I've had burnout as a BCBA and think that massage therapy might be a good change. I have also been thinking about being a physical therapy assistant. I'm trying to find a job that balances out benefits and drawbacks that are important to me.Here are some things that I think I would like about massage therapy:1. Problem solving skills- listening to goals and problems to plan appropriate solutions2. Physically active3. Lack of paperwork4. Not acting as an authority figure5. Don’t need a boss6. Mundane potentially meditative repetitive aspects (I like jobs that have repetition where you can kind of be in your head)7. A place where people enjoy coming to8. Helping people9. Not dependent on actions of others for success10. May have future opportunities to own a business if I chooseDo you think that massage therapy is appropriate for these ideas? Do you think there is anything similar I should consider? I also am worried about potential physical burnout from being a massage therapist, and I wonder if there are any options that might pay a bit better.
pl9vdj	1631232362	271	Tldr; how do I find a new career, that pays well, when I have no idea where to look?&amp;#x200B;Hi everyone,&amp;#x200B;I need some help and I figured this would be a good place to start. My big problem right now is that I want to start a career where I can make really good money one day, but I don't know where to look. I live in Denver, CO and don't much of a desire to leave. I graduated college with a B.A. in Integrative Physiology (Human Biology) in 2019, but since then I have been working as a cook for a restaurant because I still don't know what to do with my life.&amp;#x200B;I have skills surrounding biology, chemistry, physics, and some background in computer science from classes I took after graduation. My problem is that a lot of the jobs in fields I look at seem to only really have upward potential if you go back to school for an MS or PhD, neither of which I got the grades to get into. My college gpa was bad, but I am a really hard worker.&amp;#x200B;I don't know what to do for work, and I don't know where to find it. I am comfortable working in any field where I don't have to be on my feet all day, and where I could one day make good money without having to go back to school. Really, I just want to be able to afford a house and a new car before too long.&amp;#x200B;Please help me from becoming the burnout that I never wanted to be.&amp;#x200B;Thank you to all who reply in advance &lt;3
pkw6st	1631187947	102	I work full time but don’t get PTO, and I unfortunately can’t go without pay so taking time off isn’t an option for me. On top of working 40-45 hours a week I’m also a full time student which I know plays into the burnout I’m experiencing. Does anyone have any tips on helping with burnout when I’m unable to actually stop working and take a break? Today is my “Monday” and I feel like I never even got a day off because of all the other stuff I had to do these last 2 days and I’m just so exhausted and tired
pkojoi	1631153649	505	Hi everyone,Happy Wednesday!First time poster looking for input/advice/etc. I humbly ask that responses be kept kind (which is not to say they cannot be constructive - I will be mentioning political perspectives below so I just wanna keep it nice, yannow?). Also this post is long, so I will include a TL;DR at the bottom.A bit of backstory - I voluntarily left my job back in January due to burnout and mental health concerns. I anticipated taking a few months off for some R&amp;R (I did this two years ago and had great success) and then I planned to jump back into the job market.It's no surprise that the job market is bleak, to say the least right now. I do have a Bachelor's degree but it's not very useful. My professional experience has been in the nonprofit sector and then for a local credit union - one of which doesn't pay the bills, and the other which requires that I take an in-person job with minimal COVID protections.I recently turned down a job offer because about 1/3 of my job interview was meant discussing that I would need to get onboard with no masks, social distancing, vaccine verification, etc. at the job which I can't do for my own health and the health of my partner.Ethics are VERY important to me when it comes to accepting a job, as much as they apply in a capitalist system. This, again, poses an additional challenge on top of needing to be compensated fairly and minimize contact with the general public for health reasons.Queue the problem - I have a phone interview for a company on Friday. The job is fully remote, it's email-only customer service (which is my favorite), it's a local company, and the pay is well above market rate. Since I'm new to Reddit I decided to see if this company has a subreddit - which they don't, but the good people of Reddit linked several screenshots/articles/tweets stating that the CEO repeatedly donated to a very volatile (and very orange) former president, has openly bashed a former presidential candidate that I supported, AND is anti-LGBTQIA+ (and their statements about the BLM left something to be desired, almost as if they just discovered Black people have opinions). I'm not ignorant to the fact that most CEOs vote a particular way. But given that this CEO runs a small but successful company AND has made multiple decisions that actively harm communities I am either a part of and/or support...it just isn't sitting well with me.Finally, the question - should I cancel my interview? Should I accept that any for-profit companies are likely going to have similar C levels? Thanks for reading this far if you have, and heck - even if you skimmed I appreciate it.Just feeling like my moral compass and my need to eat are constantly at odds.TL;DR: found out CEO of company I'm trying to get hired at is anti-LGBTQIA+ and pro-bad orange man and it's not sitting well with me. Looking for advice.
pknnvy	1631150443	148	I’m a bit bewildered at this point. I work in web design for a marketing company and have gone through a long burnout. I took a week off, but it doesn’t seem to have helped.My performance hasn’t improved, but I haven’t been given specifics as to what I’m doing wrong other than aesthetics and missing info. We also lost a client due to website issues. So I’m aware of my fault in all of this and have basically been micromanaged out of doing most of my job. It’s been incredibly stressful and awkward, and I can tell it’s causing friction with my coworkers. I can’t even talk to them.My question is why I haven’t been fired at this point. Work has been miserable and I’m honestly ready to move into a different field altogether, I have a part time job lined up but nothing else. Should I just quit?
pk10pm	1631065814	149	For a few months now I've been getting this increasing feeling that I can't handle the work load I have. I've looked into symptoms of burnout and it seems that I'm reaching this point, if I'm not already there.I've been considering all sorts of options. Leaving my job is kind of scary because it's such a good position, on paper at least. It has all the benefits, very good salary, one of the best pension plans, very well known organization, etc.I wish I could just reduce my work load, I would even be willing to take a pay cut for that. I'm trying to say "no" more often, take planned breaks, and not care as much in order to reduce the stress but this only does so much.Has anyone ever been successful in fixing a situation where they were facing burnout? Or do people just change careers?Thanks for your input!
pi53v9	1630810462	844	First off I'd like to give a little bit background about myself. I have been working since 2017 out of college. I've been in two different jobs (technically three) and now is the third (fourth).My workplace trend seems to be getting worst while my salary goes up. It usually takes me about a year before my energy and enthusiasm started dwindle down and I lost motivation - due to none comprehensible issues I get exposed within the company. That's at least my experience from my two jobs. This new job only took 3 weeks, and I am already ready to sign off - I am freakin burnout. It all began on the first day. Since then, there was not a single day I was not cursing. It's not about transition period. I know because I've been there twice. Red flags are all over the place in both personal and professional categories/levels. I will not go into details. But I can point out few points:* Management change - manager changed WITHOUT telling me prior to on boarding. I personally heard the news first from someone on production. I was informed later by my direct.* None ISO certified - I was not surprise about this by how cluster F$%&amp;ed the place is. Also I attended a meeting regarding our pending permits and actions that we are violating and about to violate. * Backstabbing - I've been thrown under the bus 2X already. This is the only place that I immediately lost trust on people. * Micromanagement - this is the worst. I've seen this and I also experienced this personally. I was afraid that this will happen when I was told that my new manager will come from the UAE. I was not wrong. The person has no trust - asked me multiple times if I've done task A and even asked for proof (like pictures, etc) or would call me. The person started talking about his expectation that I come in at a certain time and to cover the production of the next shift (&gt;10 hours per day of work). I bought up a concern and it's my fault for being soft.* Bogus Testing - I knew this on the first day. The process does not make any sense. Upon my investigation, they have made and still making claims about their product despite failing multiple standardized test. Yikes!* No Communication - I've seen and experienced this multiple times. This is prevalent anywhere. But the magnitude of this issue in this company is exponentially high compare to my previous experiences. No body knows who is responsible for what. I've spend countless hours figuring out S$%\^ that is beyond the scope of my job. * No System - "I LOVE EXCEL" is the mantra of this place. I swear, I could see someone wearing a shirt with this phrase. I mean we're talking about a very large worldwide company and all they have is Excel.  They have no system for anything like production schedule or inventory. EVERYTHING is in Excel!!* Documentation - Their folder of document is a joke. SOP are almost none existence and are not being followed. Their documents are trash. College students do way better in documentation.AND MANY MORE. Did I forgot to mention that I've only been here 3 weeks?My point is this: do not be afraid to walk off. That employer may label you or blacklist you. It does not matter. Gather your proof and then walk away. At least you have something to show to other people when asked. People will often tell to stick and have at least two years. I say, NO! Walk away regardless of how many days, weeks, months or years you've been there. Personally, my main priority is my health. When this starts to be compromised, I am out. I owe this (being healthy) to myself, to my family, and to my friends. If you have a wife and kids, you owe them your health - you need to be healthy for them. When you get sick, none of your coworker or boss will take care of you. When you die, none of your coworker or boss will mourn and/or take care of your funeral. You live everyday and die once. When you die, that's the end of your story.Here's my advice: when your guts start telling you something, start listing things. If you can't write anything maybe it's just being overwhelmed - then it's normal. But if you can actually make a list of real things and they are even specific, it means that your gut feelings are real (and you're not being a snowflake). If you have financial problems or want to have financial stability, start/continue for job hunt. Do the bare minimum just to keep employed. Do not even bother telling your boss or HR of these issues. If they have not fix the issues then, well they would certainly not fix them now. And do you think you'll be favored over someone who's been with them years over someone new like you?
ph6ion	1630680148	146	I’m at 21 applications so far. A few retail positions, some nonprofit jobs, some for-profit remote jobs, a couple of top for-profit companies. I’m shocked how much harder it is to get a retail job because they don’t respond at all. I have a nonprofit marketing background. I run my own blog and freelance. The only only responses I got for an interview request have been for nonprofit marketing.2 interviews (no responses after, they are still hiring months after), 1 response for a follow up questionnaire (no response after, they were still hiring many months after too), 1 interview request an hour after I applied and yesterday a recruiter from a top company looked at my LinkedIn the day after I applied.Do I really have to apply to 100 - 300 jobs to find something? 😞 I’m so tired of applying already. How can I prevent burnout?
pfzvfi	1630520731	308	I've been in my job for 5.5 years.  To be frank, it's not my dream job by any means.  I couldn't care less about the work, the company, the clients, or the industry.  I just took it because I was laid off and needed a job ASAP.At this moment, we're a 700+ employee company.  My entire time here (and before my time), our team has been 3 people, and we've always been the red-headed step-child of the company, never getting the staffing, tools, or attention that we need as our company grows, despite our team now working on major projects with some of our biggest clients.  In the 5.5 years, I've seen 2 CTOs, 3 VPs, and 3 team managers.  We're always given the promises of staffing, tools, and attention, but it never happens.  Our newest VP is adamant it's gonna happen, but I'll believe it when I see it.Anyways, I'm at a point now where I still do my job, but I just don't give a shit.  I've stopped caring about sugar-coating answers for clients when things don't go their way (I'm still professional, but I don't give condolences or false hope that something may change).  I've stopped caring about trying to make sure I get to all the people that email or IM me in a day.  I've implemented a first-in-first-out system for my email and IM, and if I don't get to you within the day, then I'll get to you when I get to you.And now I'm even starting to plan my next career move, ideally into something I care about.  I like wildlife and conservation, so I'm gonna try getting into Data Analysis related to that once my wife graduates with her PhD next spring and gets on her feet with her career.
pf9qvk	1630428487	212	I've been at my current position for 2 years and lately my work load has become unmanageable. Like completely busy for 9 hours, unable to take a break, dreams are about work, and I'm missing small details here and there because I have so my many quick tasks that need to be resolved at once. I'm heading for a burnout and most of my co-workers have been burnt out for years. I've recently told my manager this is unsustainable and had a conference call with the VP of our department on how to restructure workload, but literally nothing is changing. It's like they quickly "fixed the problem" to shut me up. My manager today asked about the call...and then laughed about the situation. Like literally said "that sucks," and laughed. This is the second time since May I've had to be like "hey...this is way more than I was hired to do, I am working 9 hours straight." Last time I got a $1.50 raise out of it, but then I got *even more* work. At what point do I just throw in the towel? I'm not much of a person to give up without trying, but I also don't want to be stuck in a loop of empty promises every 3 months.
pf5c7b	1630414761	286	I made some stupid choices lately. I thought I was unhappy at my previous job because of the job, but I think i was actually having a full on burnout and just needed a breather. I left my previous job for a new one, with more responsibility, hours and a bit more pay. This was a terrible decision because now I am overwhelmed, feeling like I disappointed everyone and don't know what to do. I have informed my current boss that I don't want to continue our collaboration and I am now looking for part time jobs just so I can afford my rent, because I am mentally close to exhaustion and I can't work. I simply can't. I don't know what's going on, my mind is shut down from 9 to 5 and after work I am a normal person again. I have some leads to do freelancing but nothing certain. I also feel like there is work for me but I just want a pause. I have been working non stop for the last 6 years with brief moments of holiday (during which I was also available). I feel a constant pressure and I can't focus. It's really bad. I don't know what to do. I can't afford a break but I really need one at least one month or two. I am prepared to get a loan to just go through it, but so scared, because who does this? I started therapy but honestly it puts more financial pressure on me rather than helping... How are others dealing with this. I can't believe I am having this breakdown beginning of my career. I am feeling so guilty and can't decide which way to go.
pesokz	1630362196	182	I completed a BA in 2015 in Social work. Have worked as a health care support worker (HCSW) and receptionist and decided to pursue another degree in health care for increased pay, specifically a BSc diagnostic radiography/radiology technician in 2018.Since covid hit, everything has been online since. I failed 2 modules last semester and due to university rules, I am unable to repeat the year in the same university. I feel like this is a blessing in disguise as I really struggled with assessments and coursework. After a run in with a lecturer, I no longer feel comfortable disclosing anything to do with my personal life, which has affected my performance, leading to burnout.I like being a radiographer but research methods and image interpretation are not my strong point. I am taking the year out to take a break and unsure whether I should pick the course back up down in the next 5 years or move on altogether, preferably still within the field. Not as a nurse though.Thank you in advance. Any help or guidance, personal experience would be greatly appreciated :)
pelmk3	1630341049	528	Hi, I study psychology (specifically neuropsychology/clinical) which would make me eligible for a licence as a psychologist. That would require two more years and one year of payed internship. I could also do research, which is common.The education is not Bologna adjusted yet, so despite being done with three years I don’t have a bachelors degree, I receive the bachelor when I’m done with my master’s degree. Due to personal reasons (health and things that happened in my life) and Corona I have taken a break from my education. It also has made me question my choice of education altogether. It’s getting worse in Sweden and the jobs are taken over by less qualified people (not per se shorter ed.)...Rn I have a consultant job (sounds fancy but in Swedish it’s “bemanningsanställd” and is really crappy), but mostly do nothing and live at home. I think it would be hard for me to just continue but I realised just “waiting” for when I’m ready is not a feasible solution. So I have a few ideas. My focus is not A+, so that’s maybe my weakness (still within normal range). But I am smart and have an easy time learning. My strengths are when social sciences and natural sciences meet. I graduated high school with straight As but since I took a more social sciences “path” I am slightly limited in those heavy on natural sciences and can’t become a physician, dentist, but I can become a nurse for example. In theory I could complete it, I lack 3 courses only. I want a job:- that does not require you to live for work or burnout (literally my night mare)- where you can work part time and works with having and taking care of children- where I can be just an employee - that is very secure - that pays *decently* ie middle class income (low middle class is fine)- that doesn’t require 10000 years of education- that works internationally (pay wise too, moving shouldn’t be a downgrade) in my case especially Germany (I live in Sweden) - this is *very important*. *Which jobs would be good options?*For me, it’s not like I feel I must be able to do this job forever. *Education is free* in Sweden, so it’s not a consideration. I want to be able to be in the work force pretty soon...My options:- Just “wait” and try to come back. That idea stresses me.- Study half time and work a shit job at half time.- Take a proper “shit job” (very bad expression but strenuous/tiring and low pay) and continue until I feel ready.- Take a short polytechnic education, many of they pays are ridiculously low in Germany though. Work for that and then maybe take a year or semester at the time for my current education.- Change completely, to a degree such as nursing or teaching (takes more time but one subject would be German for me I think - I don’t know if it’s useable in Germany, but maybe I could use that in Germany as well and teach immigrants german as it’s adjusted for non native speakers). *What seems like the best option?*
peg25t	1630322311	55	Title basically, I work for 8 hours daily as a software dev, but around hour 4 or so my brain just shuts down and my ability to problem solve diminishes greatly, how do I go about pushing myself that extra few hours? Or is this normal? I've only been in this job for about a month.
ped29h	1630307599	1518	 I have a confusing thoughts about my current job, and I don't know if I should stay or I should try harder to find what I actually want/like to do/my passion. \*Please be aware that it's going to be long text below since it's more like "off my chest" post, so feel free to skip :)Allow me to explain my background first: I am a foreign female in early 30s living in Japan and just married to a local. Soon I will change to spousal visa from working visa so I think I will have more freedom to choose my own job in the near future. I can speak so-so Japanese, enough for business environment and daily life and also can speak read and write English almost fluently.I have been through working life for almost 7 years, mainly in sales &amp; mkt field for 5 years in my home country. Here is what I like about current job which I started 1,5 years ago:* It's related to electricity/power/energy, the fields that many people call very stable at least in Japan, and my place happen to be part of the biggest energy group in Japan. Being able to be part of this company makes some of my friends and colleagues envious to me. Corona doesn't impact this company at all since the demand for power will always be there forever.* I work as business development, which many people think its cool..* However my main work mostly utilize my language skill. I am the only one foreigner in this company and it is the first time they hired one. They rely heavily on me to read documents, making summaries, checking somethings in contracts, translations, etc because I am the only who can speak my country's language, English, and Japanese. Some Japs can speak English but honestly, not so well. I like it when I do this kind of work; I feel the sense of achievement and relief when I helped colleagues and customers. I got praised with this and I am motivated by praise and flatteries (though I know its not good to feed on them)* Most of the people are nice and fun. I don't see them as workaholics which is the image ppl usually have about working Japs. Although most of the workers are old and never interact with foreigner (very local company) they welcome me so much and I feel comfortable* I like the environment; unlike what I heard about other Jap companies, its easy to take leave, you are free to decide WFH schedule, my boss' manager and other higher ups are super nice, even I had fun communicating with CEO. They have many leave system in a year that it is easy to get leaves accumulated. They also have flex time, and good leave system for pregnancy and post-delivery period.* Working pace is not so crazy and actually I can say its quite relaxing. No targets. No hard pressure. Senior and boss kindly understand what my capacity is, especially as a foreigner.* This is the job where I can speak English to my boss and CEO, and I cant find much of this kind of job currently in Japan. Some vacancy that comes a lot is recruitment firms, and although I am curious about that job I heard many negative thought revolving around the stress and fast paced and competitive environment, which I might appreciate if I am still single. However I don't think that kind of fierce job is suitable for my family oriented life planSo many good points that I actually want to explain, but honestly I think so many times that this job is not "me". There are too many times I feel unmotivated and don't work at all in whole day. There are many times I imagine myself working other job in other companies. Though I mentioned no stressful pressure in the last point, I have many stressful moments where I have to bring that stress to home, thus somehow it affects my private life (we wanted to have a child soon but somehow it wont do with the work stress and anxiety).It might be related to some bad points that I think about the job and the company:* That I don't feel like I am able to release my stress to other colleague. no matter how nice they are, I am still a non Japanese, and there is always this invisible barrier that don't let me getting close to them and be able to express my worry, fear, what I want etc. The problem not only lies in language differences, the culture and mindset difference has taken a toll of my mental too.* As I said, too many old ppl in my company, hence I don't have friends of same age that I can rely to, even just for fun. I feel lonely and more stress with this.* Yeah, I get to work on something related to language skills, but actually my main job is supposed to be business development, and yeah it is a cool job, you got to see many new techie startups, talk to them and ask to be partner then sell the tech together, to Japs customers or other countries. But... I don't have the drive to do it somehow. Like, I just don't care about difficult themes and technical biz, how can I offer it to other companies? There are many days where I dont have certain task to do, that time I suposed to search startups biz and new tech and such, actively pursuing new business devs, but I just don't move.. WFH also make it worse since I always get distracted by housewife-y activities that give me more sense of achievement and motivation better.* I realized I prefer to have targets and have someone press me on what to do/what to work on, rather than "please do it your way as long as you bring the result". I already get used to getting assigned to handle certain products, learn about it, then approach \[countable\] customers in a day to achieve \[countable\] sales in a month. I don't have this now, so somehow I feel lost and don't know what I did or what I can do for this company.* The company mindset are so old that they don't utilize IT nicely. Hence, when doing WFH, I am happy that there are not much meetings or no moments like my boss are checking me every 5 mins or sth like that, no. But at the same time the motivation become so low and the anxiety of not knowing what others doing is creeping up.* No proper training or guidance from higher ups. about business investments etc. I have to learn how to read FS/BS/PL, read legal contracts, etc by myself. Yea, its good that I learn new things for my own development, and I can use it in other field in case I quit this job but.. honestly.. I don't actually care about these energy, new technology blabla things. When I learn things, I don't even know if it is correct or not because nobody can correct me anyway. I feel like jack of all trades, master of none. one day I have to do A task, the next day I have to learn B to do C, and then I was asked to do D so I learn from zero again. It keeps repeating and I see myself as a stupid person who don't remember how to do A B C D etc at all. I cannot find the "rhythm" of this job and I feel like always out of place* The theme of power, electricity, energy etc is too much for me. everything is too broad. we have to read news everyday about anything also, not to mention most of the materials are in Japanese language. I got overwhelmed easily with difficult words and vocabs.* As I mentioned before, not utilizing IT means they still do everything manually, including stamping documents, signatures, approvals, etc. Very old fashioned and might need tens of years to change the system. I cannot stand to wait for that change.* All in all, I feel I don't contribute much to this company, feeling stupid and don't know how to do the job, cannot measure what I did and what I can do in the future, and feeling like I receive salary for nothing, most of the time.Are the points above shows I have career burnout? Am I just getting tired of working?Or should I blame myself because I force myself to work in something I don't have interest to? Is it worth to leave this stable and prestigious company/field to re-start a journey of finding what I love to do? If I consult this to Japanese, they think with my current age my life plan, it is better to just stay and endure, since its not a bad company, rather, a stable company and don't give pressure much. I am posting this here to hear many other opinion, or if any of you have the same experience.

pdfwxb	1630177904	841	I want to preface by saying I'm aware of how lucky I am to be in this position.   Several months ago, I was in a very dystopian situation.   I lost my job, I lost my place.  I am grateful to have options.  I have three job offers  1. Ecologist with a private consulting firm  2. Environmental Specialist with the State Department of Environmental Protection  3. Field Interviewer with MRI Simmons Survey of the American Consumer  I have 4 areas of concern for the job offers.  My background  I got a degree in Ecology.   I worked for the State in the Department of Health during the pandemic, then I worked as an Environmental Scientist for a private consulting firm.   I also have experience conducting field interviews for the U.S. Census in 2020, and two Nonprofits before I got my degree.  The Salary  There's many factors to consider, the obvious choice is working as an ecologist or for the DEP at face value, but the salary offer for the third job offer is much higher.  I had to negotiate to bump my hourly salary to $18/Hour working for the consulting firm  The state is offering $18.75/ Hour  The third job offer has little to do with my academic background, but it is offering $22.50/Hour  Dilemna #1 (The future and FOMO)  The highest paying job offer has little to do with the Environmental field, or my career.   I don't know where I see myself after this job.  I am currently working for the private consultant, and learning a lot about the business side of things, but I am being paid the least of the three job offers, and unsure of the upward mobility.  If I work for the State, I am paid more, and with time I am sure I would be promoted to higher Environmental Specialist tiers.  If I accept the highest paid position, or the State, my fear is I may burn a bridge with the consulting firm.   We don't have a lot of those in my area...  If I don't accept the State position, reapplying and the possibility of being accepted will take months.  I've never been offered a position like the third position, in terms of salary.  Dilemna #2  (The schedule)  The third job offer allows me the most flexibility - but the expectation is night shifts and weekends.  I can do what I want during the daytime, and work as much as I want to. I'll be paid hourly.  The consultant job is also flexible, with the expectation that I work during the daytime. Given my prior experience in consulting, I know weeks may be more than 40 hours at a time.  The State job is a fixed 40 hour work week. Good to plan around, and a guaranteed time commitment.  Dilemna #3 (The location)  I have to relocate for the State job. I can split rent with two friends.  Consulting job I can stay with the parents, or pay my previous landlord if I want to move out, or split a new place with roommates.  Third job offer I could stay with parents, or move out, but the expectation is I will be sent to travel for weeks at a time, so it may not be smart to pay rent somewhere if I can stay with the parents.  Dilemna #4 (Burnout)  I worked for consulting with a large corporation, and before that for the State.  The demands of my work were always ever increasing, and stressful.  The consulting firm so far is much smaller in scale, and seems less stressful than my last firm, but the uncertainty and long work hours is a major time commitment with its own kind of stress.  The State can be brutal. I worked for the wrong agency at the wrong time I tell myself, because of the Covid-19 response and our role in it, but I know on any average given day we will have plenty workload.  I was paid a similar wage to when I last worked for the State, and for a consulting firm, so I question if the pay was worth it for that level of salary.  I don't know what to expect with the third job offer. It may be even more brutal... but perhaps the compensation is fairer...  What should I decide?  I am leaning towards the third job offer because of salary and convenience and the possibility of a less stressful work environment, but I have little to go off of for that assessment.   The fear of not having a career is the biggest concern to me.  Likely won't take the State job, because of relocation, but it has its pros and cons against working in the private sector.  Help me decide?
pd65tw	1630139663	513	I have a 1 on 1 with my manager coming up and I'm not sure if I should bring up a concern I have. He hired a new coordinator a few months ago who is a nightmare to work with. He's on day shift and I'm on evenings, so I don't have to deal with him often, but enough that he gets under my skin a lot. Plus I have friends on day shift that constantly complain about him. He has very little experience, but acts like he knows everything, so a lot of the advice he gives is wrong. He also pushes so much of his work onto other people that honestly I'm not even sure how he spends most of his time. Everyone is sick of him. Our career is high paced and creates a lot of burnout as it is, and I know he's making it harder on our staff. A few of the things I want to bring up to my manager are that he constantly pushes his work onto already overwhelmed coworkers saying he has so much to do that it'll get done quicker if someone else does it, which makes people feel like he thinks our actual workload isn't as important as his. I know multiple people who have said that they feel the only way to get ahead in our company is to schmooze with the leadership in favor of doing solid work. He is the only member of leadership (I'm in leadership too but below him) that comes for his shift only and leaves on time. Most of our staff can't even do that. I have given him direct, time sensitive tasks that he says he will get done, then just doesn't do multiple times. This has led to big problems that I had to fix. He broke 3 of our machines, all 3 are nonfunctional and will be for the next few days because he acts like he's so certain he can handle them, but can't. He also has refused to come in for 2 shifts when he was on call and has refused to call other on call people when it was desperately needed. I want to bring these up because he has another month to get his certification. If he doesn't (and based on his lack of understanding the job I don't think he'll pass his exam), our manager can demote him back to a regular staff member. Our manager can also let it slide until he manages to pass. If I bring up everything I've seen and heard from other people, maybe our manager will do the right thing for our department and demote him. I'm hesitant to bring it up because I don't have confidence in my manager. I know in the past he's basically made work hell for people he doesn't like until they quit. I don't want to be unpromotable because he decides he doesn't like me. TLDR: Don't know if I should tell my manager about how bad our coordinator is or leave it and deal with him.
pc27qb	1629992957	176	My parents recommended a job opportunity to me after many unsuccessful interview attempts elsewhere and I have been working in it for 6 months. From what I’ve been told, I get several benefits after a year of intense training, which include higher pay, more vacation time, and more job opportunities. The job security is also very strong.However, the past 6 months have been a nightmare. I don’t feel comfortable in my role, I’m struggling to grasp a lot of my responsibilities, my boss is a jerk who only makes time for me when I screw up, and the overall dissatisfaction of my experience has destroyed all desire of a career here. My mental health is taking a hit and the burnout leaves me with little energy to have a social life.Are solid benefits more important than job satisfaction? Frankly, as long as I have money after bills, health insurance, and real vacation time, I don’t really need much else. However, from another perspective I can also see why benefits could outweigh job satisfaction. What do you think?
pby0m8	1629979116	341	Hi, I’m a first generation lawyer and don’t have a lot of people to ask about these things, so I appreciate this online community of support. I graduated from a top 3 law school. I have a resume involving years of humanitarian work and social justice work, civil rights law, and business law. I recently finished a prestigious fellowship to help defend the rights of people in need. Because of the traumatic nature of my work, the life or death nature of my cases, and an abusive boss who left me in shambles, I experienced extreme burnout and had a mental breakdown. I took a couple months to recover and now my recovery looks like having a job to pay the bills with less emotionality. My school told me the {school name} would get me a job anywhere I wanted. But that’s not the case. In fact, people look at me funny when I’m not doing the 2 things people from my school do: go to a big top law firm where you do 2200 billable hours and never sleep or do heavy public interest work where it’s an uphill battle for people in desperate need and you also never sleep. I just want a job that is 9-5 or even 8-6 and is just a job. Not 8am-11pm. Just a job and not my whole identity. It doesn’t have to be law. I’m open to anything. In my interviews, I don’t mention the burnout. But people don’t know how to interpret my resume and their position. They don’t know why I want to be there even though I am genuinely interested in their firm or company and the work. It really sucks. Any ideas on how to transition into a new field without having another mental breakdown from all the rejection? I feel like there’s something wrong with me. and the imposter syndrom being a woman of color in this white man’s legal world is rough. And I don’t know how to prove to employers that I want to be there.
pb14rl	1629855160	213	I've been at the same company for 5 years and change. Last few years have been a toxic cesspool of layoffs, multiple restructurings, 50+ hour work weeks covering what was formerly 3 FT jobs, stagnant compensation, and high stress goals. I'm finding it really challenging to find the time and energy to job hunt thoughtfully while working. Especially since I'm exploring a career change, I'd like to be able to be more open in my search with my network. And I'd also just like a break to recover from burnout. I'm intending to give my employer as much notice as they want and even offer to work part-time handling critical tasks until a replacement can be found, so I'm not worried about truly burning a bridge. And if it comes down to it I can afford a 3 - 6 month break in FT employment, especially since I have some possible hustle opportunities. My question is does it reflect badly to leave a job without a new job lined up?  I'd like to keep my network from this job - both colleagues and clients. I don't want anyone to get the impression that I quit for performance related reasons. How do I message it both to my current clients and to prospective employers?
pav426	1629835517	456	I have been working in my current job for 1 year and 11 months. Things have been very tough from the start as my managing director is a very toxic boss who has created a very toxic work environment (passive aggressive, intimidating, micromanger, you name it). Despite the constant belittling, strong worded emails and general attitude towards me and my work, I have managed to survive in the company. There's generally been a high turnover rate in the past years - 6 people fired/quit in a company of 10. My only friend in this company was fired 2 months ago on the basis of her competency.In the past year, I am also attending a part time university course to obtain my professional qualification. At the start of the year, the pressures of my job, university and lockdown/wfh started severely affecting my mental health (panic attacks, depressive episodes etc). I started getting even worse comments about my performance which led me to start working long hours to deal with the workload and make sure I was doing my best. I ended up working 65+ hour weeks for a month which led me to exhaustion and burnout. To make things even worse, my director was conducting performance reviews every 2-3 weeks to assess my progress, which meant I was being criticised for everything I did wrong. I rarely got any positive feedback or comments.Somehow I managed to start performing better when the workload eased off and the performance reviews stopped. However, when I started working with my director, my performance started declining again, I started making frequent small mistakes as her intimidation and micromanaging got to me. It got to a point where I was terrified of everything I said or did as I knew it was going to be heavily criticised. I told one of my directors that I'm burning out and can't keep working like that and she told me to take 2 days off to relax and we can discuss this after my summer holiday.On my first day back, I got a notice of capability hearing which means that I have to attend the meeting to explain myself and why I have been making mistakes, why I'm not learning etc. If I fail to explain myself satisfactorily, I'll get fired. If I don't, I'll carry on working but will need to be put on constant performance monitoring. Needless to say, I need to get out of there. My question would be, do I quit or let them fire me? I'm aware that if I quit I won't be able to collect benefits but on the other hand I don't want to risk my future career by getting fired (future employers contacting the company, bad references etc).
p9a9o7	1629628775	201	We have 50 hour weeks and since I just joined a year ago, management makes sure that we take most of the workload. Our seniors just supervise and tbh sometimes do that in a really flimsy manner. Its more like I am doing you a favour by reviewing your work. Plus my manager likes the other person who joined with me and prefers them. He used to compare us a lot but now when he talks to me there’s this tone of disappointment (always). I have had severe confidence issues. I have started feeling incompetent here in so many ways and I just keep on feeling dumb. I wake up everyday to work and I just feel why do I have to work when it’s just going to be all wrong and someone’s going to criticise it? I worked almost 60 hours pls the weekend the week before and ended up having a severe burnout - to the extent that I couldn’t sleep last week. I just don’t feel like working I don’t know what to do. The place where I work pays well as compared to other places but I don’t know if it’ll make sense to shift after a year.
p8rv9t	1629554092	425	Hello everyone ! First of all I'm sorry in advance for my english.22 y/o who moved to Canada two years ago (with Covid), so I didn't really get to meet people since all of our classes were from home and also we were just 4 of us. I studied Multimedia, so we did too many things like : 3D Modeling, animation, video editing, filming, web design, game design, But we never went really in depth, but I still managed to graduated two months ago with a medal of excellence. This year has been mentally draining me since I didn't have much rest. For exemple during christmas break we had projects due till the 15th January and we came back three days later. Three months later I started working as a "video editor" and it was annoying but I had no choice since I had to pay my bills.But after I graduated I kept working with them full time, people kept saying I'm lucky, which I understand and I'm really grateful. But I still do the same video editing for more than 6 months and it's really boring and I have been doing the same for all theses months ( Cutting the video, putting lists, adding icon animation, it was just using templates, even a 11 y/o can do the same ). But I feel like I'm having a burnout, I don't enjoy what I'm doing, I feel like I can't be creative as I used to be and now thinking if really this is the path for me. Also they have been giving me urgents projects where I had to do the layout, but I just don't get myself to do a great work since I never enjoyed and never been interested in doing page's layouts. I feel like i'm starting to hate work, to hate myself, I even have to work overtime some times, since I start really early in the morning to finish early ( I'm not paid for the extra hours, for example i worked from 7am to 6pm last Monday and Friday).I used to have a fun life when I was in France. Going out with my friends, parties, doing various things, but since I came here, nothing. With Covid I just stay home, work and workout. I also can't do anything since I have to keep working to get my residency.&amp;#x200B;I'm really sorry for the way I write, I'm not really used to writing like this. Has any of you went through something similar ? And what did you do ?
p7u95x	1629430523	505	Hey guys, I have a question for anyone who wants to answer. IN the last couple years I decided to pursue a career in videography. One day I decided to Start doing some videography, YouTube and video editing on the side and I fell in love. I loved the entire process of producing content and decided to make this my goal. I felt great about the path I was on. I was one of those people that always struggled to know what he wanted to do, I still am. I am a creative and finding work that is fulfilling is essential. I truly felt like I finally found what that was. It was an incredible feeling. Six months ago I got a job at a marketing firm where I live. I produce video content for businesses, produce podcasts, and get to invest in myself creatively daily l and get paid for it. For months I absolutely loved it and truly felt that I found my "calling".Six months down the road from starting, I started to feel not as excited about my work. I didn’t feel the same drive to get my work done as I did before. That spark is just gone. Now there are times where Sitting in front of a computer and editing sounds terrible. Going on a shoot seems like the last thing I want to do. This happened kind of suddenly. I don’t feel I was working hard enough for it to be burn out. I’ve felt like this for a couple weeks now. I don’t know, it just feels like a job. I am someone who creative and want fulfilment in their job, I had it for a while but now that fulfilling feeling is just gone. I’m reaching out on here because I don’t know what this means. Is it burnout? Is it an indicator that this is not the ideal career path for me? Am I just in the dip? Like Seth Godin says. I just don’t know how to process this feeling. I was at an all time high and now I feel like it is not for me. For years I tried to find work I loved and I found it, now I feel like this and it makes me depressed.I feel like what happened was the novelty just wore off, which makes sense. But at the same time, I hate having the feeling that I just don't want to do this thing anymore. I don't want to pursue something else if the same thing is just going to happen again. Maybe I'm just really damn lazy? Because I am lol.  I am also a musician, and really want to pursue that as well. At this moment I want to pursue that much more. My goal with this is to be a produce / composer. Also seems ALOT harder to find success in. I just hate that my feelings are so different so quickly about video. Anyone have similar feelings? Would love some thoughts. Thanks guys.
p7mzsf	1629405054	231	Feeling stuckI’ve been at my current company for eight years. It’s the only place I have worked where I could have a career (not because I move jobs often, it’s just where I started out once I was able to have a “real job”). I am currently in a supervisor position with the sales team.   I’d really like to make a change, but am feeling stuck for a few reasons. - my resume is not great and I think I need professional help with it, but I’m not sure where to start.  Is LinkedIn premium worth it?- I think the longer I stay here, the harder it will be for me to work elsewhere. We are dated in our technology compared to our competitors, so I worry that without some of that knowledge, I’m being held back. - I feel like my pay is pretty decent, so it may be difficult for me to find something I would enjoy doing with equal or better pay.- I’m pretty sure I know what I’d like to do. Sales operations manager, but I think it’s hard to get that type of position without having held the title. I do a lot of those duties in my role now, but it’s not my job title. This is a messy post, just struggling a little today with my burnout and thought I’d post here.
p5o2zi	1629144765	280	I'm 35 and have been working in paid media (marketing, mostly digital) for roughly 10 years. After a year of unemployment during Covid (and not having worked full time for nearly 3 years), I snagged a 100% remote job as an Associate Media Director at a top agency. It didn't take much time at all to quickly realize I was miserable and the work was never going to stop coming.I lasted 2.5 months, and we mutually agreed it was best for me to resign.I don't know where to go next. I hate media, I'm not really a numbers guy. I hate working in an office. I hate working 40+ hours a week. The work is really hard and doesn't come naturally to me even though I have had a good relationship with all of my employers, but I constantly feel like I don't know what I'm doing. This is wreaking havoc on my mental health. I literally shut down in my off hours/weekends and don't see family or friends, just lie in bed and feel sad.I have a communications degree. I don't really think going back to school is a smart idea, because nothing really interests me. Any recommendations for what a marketer could pivot into? My next thought is to just start applying to more junior roles in my field. I may get paid less, but easier work may be better for me.   Lastly, my next thought would be to find another job based around marketing but for a company that really owns their work life balance, but I seem to be terrible at finding those.Any recommendations about what I should do? The work depression just kills me.
p5hf9l	1629124937	232	I'm just out of college and I'm interning right now at a relatively small company that works in the supply chain analytics field. Even though the strength is small, the clients are some pretty big names which is why I joined the company in the first place.But nearly a month since joining, I've realised I'm working the most I've ever worked in my life. I've interned before and my experience was that it is more of a learning experience than what I'm experiencing now. There was practically no training and all of the interns who joined with me were thrown into the deep end. You're straight up answerable to clients about things that you're still learning. The work is about 12 hours a day on average for six days a week with really heavy deadlines. And there is incredible pressure from the management.  Two of the four people who joined with me have already left because they can't handle the pressure.I'm interning to learn, but the stipend is measly and doesn't even justify for 1/3rd of the work I'm putting in, barely scraping minimum wage in my country.I'm getting to learn a lot of new things but the burnout is insane. Once I'm done with my work I don't have the energy to take my poor dog for a walk. I'm considering to start looking for other opportunities, is it too soon?
p5dpro	1629111359	318	I have been working my current job for 4 years. The work environment is very busy and demanding at times, and causes me stress and anxiety. I burned out this spring, and took some weeks off before gradually getting back to it over a couple of months. Also got a few therapy sessions, and I am doing better now, but the busy environment keeps wearing me out to where I'm scared of another burnout. Other colleagues are also unhappy with the stressful job, which also makes it worse as this also affects my anxiety. There are some things I like about my job, and I do like my colleagues, but I realize something has to change for the sake of my mental health. My boss is aware of the issues in our workplace, and trying to do something about it, but I fear it will take some time before things really change if they ever do. One of the options I am considering is to ask if I could work 80%(4 days a week + emergencies(being on call)). I would be able to afford it, and I would still have enough left over for savings. The stress at work would be the same, but maybe having more time away from it would help me cope. At the same time I fear my anxiety will still be the same, and I will lose money and cause problems for my colleagues without gaining anything from it. Another option is of course to change jobs, but there are not many suitable positions in my area and completely changing my career would take some time and maybe some extra studying. Salary wise it will probably be approximately the same. I don't know what would be the best way forward.  Anyone here who experienced burnout? Or anyone who's tried working less for similar reasons? I would love to hear any experiences or advice.
p3w5el	1628895091	154	Any advice on attending med school later in life would be appreciated. I'm 36, last attended college 15 years ago, and I'm working to develop a ten-year plan. Newly-single, no kids, no real estate, feeling aimless/footloose. I'm not even tied to a lease, I could go anywhere in the world (anywhere English is the lingua franca, that is). I'm employed full-time in a white-collar non-medical field. My pay is good, I've put aside significant savings over the years, but I'm better than this and I'd like to do better for the world at large.Thanks to COVID and concomitant burnout, I foresee the medical profession facing major personnel shortages in the not-so-distant future. That's something I can help with. I will be going back to school for something, just curious how to know if MD is right for me.In the interests of full disclosure, I'm neurodiverse, an amazing test-taker, and empathy/bedside manner aren't my strong suits.
p3vbwc	1628892439	1241	tl;dr Went to manager to ask for help after experiencing burnout, was met with hostility and still didn't receive support&amp;#x200B;Very long story, but I will try and keep it as short as possible. I manage a remote team of consultants that travel every week across the country, and report up to a Sr. Leader who I was just recently transferred to in an effort to minimize the amount of employees to manager. I have worked in this organization for about 10 years, and worked my way up from an entry level position to where I am now. My new manager, also came up through the ranks, although, not from an entry level position, but rather in a project manager role and has been in the organization for a couple more years than me. It is very well known throughout the organization that she is a very direct person, leaning heavily on "hard ass" - but I had always seen it in a positive light since her approach was direct but respectful.In recent years, as she grew from individual contributor (project manager) to manager of people, the approach seemed to have changed a bit and I was witness to a few situations where she was cussing at her direct report for something they had failed to do. That in itself did not jive well with me, but in my mind I made excuses that she probably has that type of relationship with those employees. I had also never worked under her, or reported directly to her, but always in a lateral role.Fast forward to the last 12 months - she was promoted to senior leader, and is now responsible for managing managers. Things have been chaotic to say the least within our organization due to fast growth, but nothing we are experiencing are unique things to us and not anything that can not be resolved. However, the consistent changes that involve unclear communication and expectations from our leadership, unmanageable workload, lack of support, and unreasonable time pressures have created a situation in which most employees, including managers are burnt out. For the first time in my career, I was given a low performance appraisal score and even worse, my "performance issues" were not addressed with me ahead of my performance appraisal review - I was completely blindsided. I also did not walk out of my performance appraisal with any actionable next steps on how to improve my performance. This ended up being the straw that broke the camels back so to speak, as it went completely against my values and how I approach leadership.I myself was pulled from work by my psychiatrist due to burnout - and after discussing with my therapist, we came to the determination that it was due to the underlying issues within my organization that are out of my control. We came to the conclusion of organizational burnout and moral injury - both terms that I was not familiar with prior to my situation. In retrospect, those two terms make perfect sense as I have been seeking help from my leadership for the last 12 months as my efficiency has declined, and I couldn't figure out why. I have also publicly expressed that I feel I have had to "lower my values and work ethic" in order to continue executing in my role without going crazy.Needless to say, this eventually took a toll on me and I ended up being out for 10 weeks, where I was able to finally disconnect from work and take a step back to reprioritize my values and goals. However, by the end of my first week back I was in the same place psychologically that I was prior to going on leave.With me reporting to this new manager, I scheduled time with her to address my performance and ask for help on improving. I knew it would not be an easy conversation, but I walked in with the full intention of being open and honest, recognizing the gap in performance and seeking support and guidance on next steps. In retrospect, I think I walked into this meeting wanting to know that my manager had my back.To start the meeting, I asked my manager for permission to speak freely and openly, without having to edit my thoughts or worry about it making sense - of course in a respectful manner. She agreed, and I started getting things off my chest - my concerns stemming from things my team was expressing to me in confidence, support for me and other managers in my same role as well as role clarity, and a few other topics. I was very open and honest, and I allowed myself to be vulnerable as I felt I had the psychological safe space with this person, my manager, whose success is gauged in large part by the success of her managers.WOW, was I ever wrong. In essence, I was told to "suck it up" and do my job. She kept interrupting me while I tried to voice my concerns, and I was shamed for not being able to do my job when asking for role clarity and guidance on improving. I was asked if I "wanted love" when I mentioned support for the managers, and was scolded for not providing a psychological safe space for my employees to voice their concerns, when I specifically mentioned them coming to me with their concerns but not wanting me to relay those things further up for fear of retaliation and them potentially losing their job. I was really caught off guard when asked if I felt our meeting was "a waste of time", and when I asked for clarification, she confirmed that since I was departing anyway (I have not confirmed that I am leaving, only that my professional goals do not align with my current role) were we wasting time by talking about all this as it is a lost cause. What I experienced in that meeting shook me to my core to say the least, will haunt my dreams for a long time. I can not help but think what could have happened to my family or myself had this conversation taken place prior to me going on leave when I was at the lowest point psychologically, emotionally, and physically. I am beyond dumbfounded with this situation, and although I had already made the personal decision that my current professional needs do not align to the organization and thus I needed to move on, my focus is now raising awareness to this manager, as I am afraid someone else can encounter the same situation I did and them not being a good mental space potentially leading them to drastic measures. I have now heard from multiple leaders across the organization, some at my level and some at hers, that have encountered a similar situation with her already - which semi-confirms I am not far off on my perception of the situation, and only makes raising awareness a bigger priority. I am also genuinely concerned about retaliation at this point, and concerned about what this person is willing to do to get me in trouble. If you were me, would you seek to meet with Human Resources to discuss/document my experience to raise awareness (not seek disciplinary action for my manager), and if so any advice on how you would frame the conversation? Any thing I need to be on the lookout for?
p39fxv	1628804034	570	Product management internship in an NYC tech firm in 2015 that I enjoyed and found fascinating. Struggled a bit with mental health going into senior year of college, got on some meds. Graduated in 2016 majoring in Marketing and Information Systems. Fell in love with \*the idea\* of running my own business upon graduating and didn't have anything lined up. Had a little bit of success and traction while pursuing an MBA the following year. 2018 nearly hit it big with the business, but I consecutively ran into a bit of burnout. Psychiatrist ripped me off some meds too fast and threw me into a period of disabling depression (no I'm not trying to make this a sob story). Had to put the breaks on the business and still living with parents. Still living with parents an hour outside NYC, when I was able to leave the house and function, I got a job with a local IT firm despite not wanting to work in IT (I've had some previous IT experience, &lt;60 people at the company). I did the IT thing with low pay for about 7 months, while applying to jobs in NYC but only got one interview that fell through. Then covid happened. Both the pandemic and the failed job hunt threw me into a bit of a rut again. Fortunately this firm I'd been working with gave me an opportunity to do something outside of IT.  Their digital marketing effort over the years had been haphazard and outsourced. The previous team had recently fallen apart, while still having a portfolio of 50 clients' websites to maintain. They threw a colleague of mine in there to keep things going, then a few months later recruited me to help the effort...and ideally help reorganize this arm of the company. This was about April/May 2020 while working from home.For the most part, that colleague has been doing most of the heavy lifting, while I've been mostly doing stuff he hasn't had the time to do (in effect I'm the pressure release valve for his workflow). I'm still working on the mental health situation and they've been understanding of that thankfully. My responsibilities vary widely but all fall within the range of a traditional web dev/digital marketing skillset. Consulting clients on UI/UX, making changes to existing websites, ideating new designs, fixing things when they break w/ old sites, reporting web analytics to clients who request it etc. I enjoy elements of the job but I'm very siloed and don't have enough communication with people at the firm.They've wanted me to take the reigns a little more without really offering much incentive to do so, and my drive to wind up in the city is more now than ever. I'm not a fan of the firm in general- I still feel like I've settled for working there because I needed a job when I was in that really bad rut to re-integrate into society (I was in hermit mode for 6 months in a bad way).All in all, I'm looking to see what direction I can take with my overpriced education, and failed business experience. Being 5 years out of school, the existential anxiety is certainly overwhelming to get my shit together, and I know having a clearer direction will ultimately help my mental health more. I ideally want to work for a large company but I can't be too picky.
p2tqtn	1628747418	847	I've been at my current role for a couple years. I started in a sales role right before the pandemic and met my quota even through the worst of COVID. I've wanted to leave for a while because even though I've mostly been able to hit my sales quota, it's incredibly stressful each month because I work in low-volume sales---one new client can make or break it for me. I'm also the only person in this role at the company, so there's an added layer of fear every single day. I was given zero guidance when I started, except to hit quota. Just because I accomplish it doesn't mean it's not mentally draining and unsatisfying work. I've tried so many different ways to improve things, but between zero guidance and nitpickiness, everything I do is ultimately wrong in some way, so I mostly quit trying to do anything more than the bare minimum. I feel set up for failure.Lately, I'm noticing signs of burnout because it's frustrating to have minimal control over a situation or guidance but maximum responsibility, and some changes in management feel extremely toxic. I haven't had a single raise since I've been at the company, so I figured that at least I'd ask for one before I quit. (I hadn't asked at my one-year mark as the company had lost clients during the pandemic, and it didn't feel right to ask. Yeah yeah yeah, I know I should've, but I can't go back in time) In early July during my quarterly review, my boss commended me on awesome performance. I asked for a raise. She said she agreed I was due for one, and that in early August she and I would meet and she'd present me with a couple different options (one being a more stable salary, and the other being one with much more room for potential earnings). A month seemed like a long time to wait but I said okay.During the month of July, I learned that I'd received a raise at my part time side job. (my main job doesn't know I work here) I enjoy it, it's easy, and it has super flexible hours and pays well enough that I could easily cover my expenses plus an extra $500-800ish/month on top of that. I've been working there the past 3 years, and over time, it's helped me to save an emergency fund equivalent to two years' worth of living expenses. Over the past few weeks, I also received multiple nitpicking, micromanaging messages from the new manager in which she called out incredibly minor mistakes I'd made (ie a single mispelling in a 35 page proposal that has zero repercussions). I'm all about constructive criticism, but to call me out in a googlechat room with multiple people doesn't sit right with me. Let me know what I did wrong and let me fix it instead of trying to humiliate me. She's only been doing this over the course of the past few weeks, so it feels like she's actively trying to make me look bad and sabotage my chance at a raise.Fast forward to Monday, when I'd been looking forward to chatting with my boss and hearing my potential raise options. My boss essentially gave me some goals and said that I would "have the opportunity to work on them, and then September 30th I'd be able to present to her the amount I would like for a raise". That day, I later learned from two of my close coworker friends that THEY had been OFFERED raises at their quarterly reviews, even though they'd only been there for less than a year. They deserve it, but the fact that my boss clearly didn't think that i did made me want to quit on the spot.I appreciate that some workplaces ask you to present/justify your reasoning for a raise. Sure, fine. What bothers me is the principle of the situation, that she'd string me along after telling me I was doing everything right, only to tack on an extra couple months til we can revisit the raise thing. I've only ever received positive feedback, and to know that my coworkers were offered a raise yet I was not, that alone feels like reason enough to leave.Actions speak louder than words, and I feel like this company doesn't value me so it's time to move on.  My plan is to maintain my integrity and keep things respectful and civil. There are so many, many things that I want to tell my boss when I quit, but also, I don't care and don't feel like I owe her any sort of useful feedback. If you were me, what would you say to this boss when you put in your two weeks' notice? Is it worth it to even try to explain the situation and how I feel? Or do I just say "hey, putting in my two weeks', thanks"?TL;DR: my main job is triggering extreme stress/burnout and I'm ready to move on, what should I say to my boss when I quit?
p2epyp	1628693872	318	So. Ive been here before. My job is just ruining me... I havent said to the extent... But. I just... Really cant afford to live like this. The hours take away my entire day... Im less emotionally in tact with the people i know and love. And im just losing myself... And its not wven good pay... Im 19 i am byno means lazy. I am intelligent and can get the job done 100 percent. Im just on such a high level of burnout and the hours i work are just aweful. And inflexible. I want to learn a trade. A hands on skilled trade. Think electricians. Carpenters. Im not sure what i want to go into. I need help foguring out the pros and cons of different ones and finding some that perhaps i havent come across. It would be ideal if i could get a paid apprenticeship early on in learning it. Like 6 months to a year. So i can get out of my job and start doing something that will lead me to a better future. Something i cna be excited about. My job is deadend. Unchanging. And ive been at max capacity of skill since my 3rd month in. Its been about a year now. Are there any ideas? Id like to find something i can one day make up to 50k or more per year. Even if it takes some years to get there. And like i said. Of i could start working as a paid apprentice to get a job in that field that i can be excited about would be phenomenal. Preferably something that might have flexible hours. Like some days im working this time. Or others this time depending on jobs maybe? Because working the same shift every day and my current shift taking up every hour of daylight is just... Life draining... Thanks to anyone who might offer suggestions.
p27rrn	1628664677	168	Hey everyone,I (24, F) am a junior digital marketer at a startup for (1.5 yrs) and I have been struggling lately to work at a fast pace and do my best work. Recently my manager has told me that she is not happy with the rythm i work at and with my overall results. It seems like i am not productive enough and lack initiative. She gave me a deadline to make it work, so right now I have about 2-3 weeks to make a visible change. I feel overwhelmed and I cant tell if it's just burnout or it's time to quit and find something else. Point is, I am not sure how to make this visible change without killing my mental health and my little leftover free time to be ..human. I like my job and have been grateful to have it but lately it has been a huge struggle for me. I could use some advice from this community. Thank you! Wish you all the best.
p1y1dv	1628628722	285	I’ve been working in marketing for about 7 years at different non profits and even an ad agency. For the most part I enjoyed the work. I love being creative and was passionate about the non profits I worked for. I always had great feedback and the support to really excel in my field. Over the past two years though, everything changed and I started to dread going into work. My last job was at an ad agency and I pushed myself really hard to get all the work done. I worked extra hours to the point I was dreaming about work every night. I quit that job for a new position at a non profit I really respected. I’ve been there for 8 months and have been struggling to meet their expectations. I’m constantly tired and feel like I’m putting little creative thought into my work because of the brain fog. My boss bullies me every week to the point she pushed me to resign. I’ve never had this bad of feedback before and am worried this is what my next job will be like too. The office is clearly toxic but I’m constantly worried it’s because I’m not good enough. It’s pretty clear that I’m struggling with burnout. I have a history with depression and anxiety, so overall my mental health is not doing great. Does anyone have advice on how to handle burnout? Do I need to pivot my career or take a really long vacation? Help!TL;DR: I’ve been struggling with career burnout for the last 2 years and have started to perform poorly at work because of it (which is unlike me). I’m looking for advice on how to combat career burnout.
oynql7	1628185808	251	I have been working in client service and sales for about 4 years for a major financial services company. For a while now I have been seeking a new career path due to some extreme burnout and declining mental health and that I have found myself to be really passionate about data analytics / science especially compared to how much I hate client service and sales.Due to needing a way out of my current career and my undergrad not being related I have applied to and have been accepted to full time online MS analytics program. This is a fairly affordable program and I have enough savings to cover most of my living expenses for the program but tuition will be from loans.However, just recently my company and my boss (who does not know about this MS program) have been opening doors for me to make this career shift internally. However, it is notoriously difficult to make a career shift away from client service to anything not client related at my firm so I can't help be skeptical. I know the best answer is to switch to another company but with an unrelated undergrad even getting an interview has been difficult. My question is, should I just switch to a full time MS analytics program and take on all the debt and drain my savings or trust my company to do the right thing for me and my career after they haven't installed a ton of confidence over the last 4 years?
oynnvj	1628185576	357	Ok so I’m gonna try to condense my dilemma. I’m currently a speech language pathologist who has been in the field for 7 years. Almost all of my career is in the schools. I love the kids but I’m worn out on all the paperwork and the fact I feel my therapy is not quality due to high caseloads. I also just felt like I never fit in. People made fun of me in grad school because I am not super type A and I was not organized. My skills have changed a lot though and I am much more organized. I love the vacation time the schools provide and the pay is decent. I have a masters and I was very lucky to get a large chunk of student loans forgiven due to working 5 years in title 1. However, I had a life altering trauma 5 years ago. I felt like it opened my eyes to my purpose. I want to help other victims of crime. I have been speaking at conferences on trauma and every time I attend I feel so passionate and fired up about the work people are doing. In my current job I feel like we are forcing ableism on people. I applied to master of social work programs and I have been accepted to one that is part time online. This lets me work part time in the schools and do schooling part time. The things that scare me are more student loans and the fact everyone tells you not to do social work due to burnout. I’m scared I’ll make a wrong choice.I have been guided though that the social work degree gives me options. I don’t see myself as a speech therapist for 30 more years. I am having trouble knowing if I am making a good decision. On top of that I live in California so cost of living is high. How have others handled mid career change? What are your thoughts on this situation? I want to add I am blessed to have options and very aware of that so I do want to add that acknowledgment.
oy9o4l	1628135961	1846	Hi everyone, I recently turned 25 years old and am struggling with choosing a career path. I'm so grateful to have 3 potential career options because I know finding a job and having the privilege to go back to school is a blessing and not a reality for a lot of people. I myself was in the struggle just a few weeks ago... how these opportunities came all come at once has been encouraging but also understandably a little stressful. I could really use some advice and/or feedback. Unfortunately I don't have anyone who I can talk to about this in person. For reference I'm an INFJ and I'd say it's very accurate based on what I've learned from it.For quick background - I'm currently surviving off of side hustles. I graduated from school in 2018, worked in corporate for close to 1 year, struggled for several months to find a career, and decided to put more effort into side hustles. I was able to move back home and save everything that I made, something I never take for granted and am immensely grateful for. As I get older, the more and more financial security becomes to me. It's always been something I've cared about and strived for, but with my degree in liberal arts, despite graduating with the top of my class with solid internship and work experience, it's been extremely difficult. This is something I am seriously considering as I look into my next position, but it's not everything...Option 1 - Go back to school. I'm interested in going into the medical field and shadowed in a hospital a few weeks ago. I had the time of my life... it was the only time I had ever left a job and felt happy. I can trust this emotion and my experience because when I went in I was in the pit of horrible and serious depression that had not wavered for a solid 2 years. I don't think I've ever smiled throughout the day as much as I did then. I shadowed for 12 hours and inside, I didn't want to go back home. I thought about the patients all day the following day.. even to this day I think about them and hope they're okay. I was encouraged by the person I shadowed to pursue this as a career. To do so, I would have to take some pre-req classes. The pay would be excellent, over 100k first year starting. The downside: on call a few times a month, at least two 12 hour shifts are expected per week, etc. I think I would be fine with 12 hour shifts because everywhere I've worked, once I'm "in the zone," I'm locked in. Another downside: The schooling is going to be a brutal 3 years. I'm talking I can basically kiss my life goodbye. For a satisfying career, though, this would personally be worth it to me. I've discovered from previous work experience that I absolutely cannot work somewhere - doesn't matter how much I'll earn - that I'm not connected to the mission/not helping others/I don't see a deeper meaning to it. This career path would be 100% fulfilling, although I'm concerned about burn out. Option 2 - A friend of mine introduced me to another friend of theirs a few years ago. We've stayed in touch and they've been generous with their time, advice, and seem to be a great person - this is before any business talk between us happened. They own and run an incredibly successful business. This person is extremely well-connected, known in their field, etc. Pretty much when you think of a (what it seems to be) competent, friendly, helpful, and encouraging CEO, that is this person. Never in my life did I think an opportunity would come from this person. I liked them as an individual and that was it. We kept in touch here &amp; there and when they asked me how life was going during the pandemic, I was honest (which is rare for me, I abhor talking to people about my personal life and feelings). I said I was struggling to find work and it was draining... that I was worried about my future and felt completely lost. About a year before the pandemic, they attended one of my public speaking events and frequently complimented and encouraged me to transition that into a career. They offered to casually start mentoring me or offer any advice I may need. I brought up option 1 to them and they said respectfully that it wouldn't use all of my skills and I wouldn't be able to reach my full potential. I can see where they were coming from. They opened a door for me and said that I have a lot of skills and previous work experience that matches up with their company. They said if I'm interested - no pressure - that if I wanted to, I could start as an admin position. I would help every department and him. He said all employees are equal and hold each other accountable. He mentions every employee (it's a small company; everyone goes through a vetting process or has a personal connection to him to work there - jobs there are not open to the general public). I read up on the credentials of all the employees and everyone who works there is crazy smart. He said that as I'm in the role, I'll learn from everyone there and that he's going to mentor me. At around 1 year, we're going to touch base and I'll move into another role within the company. He said it's going to be an excellent opportunity for me to gain experience that I can leverage anywhere either in the company or not. I agree. I would be compensated ridiculously for an admin position, and with bonuses and stock options, it's going to be close to 80k which is insane. So those are the pros, plus I'll be able to work a lot remotely which means I can save even more of the income. Cons: I asked him about work-life balance and he said that everyone who works there works *a lot* because they genuinely love their jobs and this is their life's passion (which eh... I can believe since most of them have dedicated their lives to this; nearly everyone who works there has a PhD with 5-10+ years of experience and have started their own companies within the same field while still working at this company). Another con is I'm extremely scared this is going to be a dead-end job. Right now I have great relationships with the medical staff at the hospital where I shadowed and they've opened more doors for me. I have serious potential there and I'm afraid of losing this. At the same time, this admin role could set me up.... but I'm 25 and I'm tired of trying different jobs with the hopes that it will turn into something more. This person is in their 60's and we share the same life beliefs, faith, etc, but I fear they might be looking at me as a naive although smart young person who they can get to work hard for them for.... nothing, really except the longing that this might lead to another position. He also seemed a little turned off when I asked about work-life balance and said "I'm concerned when someone has other hobbies or interests because then that means that they're not really passionate about the cause. This has to be their life's calling, not just a job." That was kind of a red flag for me... I'll be honest, I care deeply about what his company does and I believe in their mission, but it's not my calling. I love nonprofit and volunteering and mentioned this to him years ago before when we were talking about careers and such and he said there's no money in nonprofit, you're often strained wearing multiple hats, the money runs out quickly and it's stressful for everyone, etc. Another (ish) con is it seems like he gives multiple opportunities to mentor/help women. I find this to be wonderful, but I'd be lying if I said it doesn't raise some suspicions. Maybe he helps men too, but from the stories I've heard from him, it's been about women. He does have powerful women on his board and his VP is an older woman. I don't know if I'm overthinking this. He and his wife have a large age gap (a little over 10 years), but I know she also struggled finding her way through life in her 20s. It's a scary decade not knowing what path to pursue. His wife was super encouraging of me joining and kept saying how this is an incredible opportunity he wouldn't and hasn't offered to anyone else. He said he hopes I know he's not just tooting my horn or saying this to everyone, that he seriously sees potential in me and wants to help. I think it's an excellent opportunity but for some reason I just feel uneasy about this and I don't know why?Option 3 - Work at a nonprofit. In an excellent location, I love the cause and it's been something I've cared about my entire life and always swore to myself even as a child that I would commit my life contributing towards. It's nothing fancy - a small local nonprofit that pays all of it's employees equally at 50k. No dental insurance although there is health insurance. I don't think they offer stock options or a retirement package, although I could be wrong. There is tremendous need for this type of work where I live (and frankly all over the world). It's a small team of employees and I've had a few brief interactions with some of them. They've all been lovely... this a common theme that I notice with social workers and nonprofit people: they're genuine. They don't pretend to be anything other than who they are. They care deeply about people. Great work-life balance. I truly think I would be incredibly fulfilled working here, same as the hospital if not more since I'll have extra time to devote to the things I'm passionate about (traveling for humanitarian projects, writing, reading, painting, seeing my friends, having time for faith-based activities, etc). Cons: I'm worried the pay is going to get to me, especially when it's 2-5 years in. I'm worried about burnout through helping people. I'm going to have to work on site so will have to move into the area where rent is inflated and prices for basic household goods are ridiculously high. I don't know what in the world to do and am feeling conflicted. I need to make a decision soon and unfortunately don't have the luxury of time on my side as I would need to start college classes to make it to the deadline to apply for programs within the speciality I'm interested in. Any advice or feedback would be much appreciated.
oy8rbf	1628132504	202	I met with my supervisor to share my concerns that the team is operating on a very low morale. We have been open and providing services to an increasingly rude public during and throughout the pandemic with less than half the staffing we had prior to the pandemic. All the duties of the staff that left have been heaped onto those that remain without increase in pay or title.&amp;#x200B;When I shared that morale is low, supervisor seemed surprised. If they ever worked the floor with us, I think they would already know who was experiencing burnout, and other colleagues have even brought it up in all staff meetings, but it was never responded to. The supervisor simply asked me to name who shared these remarks, but I don't want to out anyone as being miserable on the job. To me it is obvious who is having a hard time and who is not. I simply wanted to bring this up because it is a widespread enough issue that the entire staff could benefit from addressing the emotional exhaustion of the type of work we have had to tackle during this difficult time. Now I feel trapped and I don't know how to proceed.
oy3vwy	1628115791	98	I’ve been working in biotechnology for about two years after graduating and I’ve begun to feel unfulfilled in my work. It doesn’t feel like what I went to school to do, I used to love the science and now I feel like I hate my job. I thought it was the company at first but after a change, the challenges remain the same and management is equally fascist, only the pay is worse. Does anyone know if things get better from here? Are there strategies that can help placate these emotions? Do I need to just change careers altogether?
oxwd92	1628094472	326	I am currently working in a call center and am experiencing burnout and an high anxiety. This call center job happens to be through a staffing agency.I am losing sleep, work performance is declining and my anxiety is so bad that sometimes i put myself in "idle" status so that calls won't route to me because I have been having panic attacks.Last year or so I had been interested in transitioning into the Technology/IT field but since I had no experience or education, I was told by recruiters it would be extremely hard to get into the field. During the pandemic I self-studied and obtained entry-level IT certification (which I know is not a catch-all solution but thinking it may help a little bit).The problem I have now is that I have no job lined up ( been applying like crazy on LinkedIn, Indeed, Ziprecruiter, through the staffing agency) but am desperately needing to get out of the call center job due to the immense stress it is putting on me.I do have some spare funds to fall in if I were to just up an quit with no backup. But because it has been so hard to get callbacks from applications, I dont know if that would be unwise because I could cause myself more stress by quitting and not being employed for quite some time in between. The other problem I face is that my call center job is through a staffing agency. I am not sure how to tell them I want to quit without burning a bridge. I typically dont like to share with an employer if the reason for leaving is stress. I also don't want to hinder my chances at getting work through them in the future.tl;dr:  my current job is so stressful that I need to leave ASAP but I'm having trouble finding work in the new career field I'm interested in and have no idea what to do.

ox2kaq	1627994165	299	Hello!Its so hard to exit out of customer support, once you get into it.I worked in a customor support at telecommunications for 6 years. After reaching serious burnout, my previous supervisor found out I am searching for a new job. She invited me to work for her at insurance, in a brand new contact centre.I was coach at my old place, knew every little process. At this new place, I came in just to be coached by a 24 yr old bossy Karen, which was here months before me and has experience in insurances. Understandably, I did need to get coached, but her attitude is making me feel anxious about this job. Also, insurances are not exciting or making me passionate at all. Every day is same 8 hours. Im 3 months here and not feeling happy. I just got an offer by a fintech company. They had an ad for two positions. I applied for customer support, but also they mentioned they can offer a job as a tech trainer. This would involve travel and training new companies in using the software.The company is growing fintech with 500+ employees, I clicked with them at an interview. They seem exciting. The downside is that here I have a permanent contract  while I'd get one year contract(s) there. They mentioned I would be also have freedom to work on things I wished for besides my main duties, If I was good at them (marketing etc.)Salary at the start of a new job would be lower (by 15 -20%). Do you believe salary in startup could be better down the road, as the company grows? At my current job, salary I have is as is, no potential to frow any time soon.I would appreciate any opinions, which would help me decide
owoqpu	1627940932	310	Over I really hate I do as a Civil Engineer but I really shouldn't. My boss is awesome, my job is easy (arguably way too easy), my work life balance is great, I’m paid quite well but my job is just so boring it sucks every bit of joy from my soul. I always thought it could be burnout, but I don’t actually work hard enough or use any significant portion of my brain to really be close to burning out. I really  tried giving the career an honest chance, I thought my first job was the problem and switched to another company that promised me more interesting work and after 4 years of working professionally it’s just all the same. There’s no need for me to really learn or grow professionally, I feel like I’m mentally stagnating and lost every ounce of ambition I’ve had. I loved my time studying in college, but now my masters feels like a waste of time. I anticipated work is something that will never be fun, but literally nothing I’ve done has ever been even the slightest bit exciting or interesting.  For a new career, I really want something that will be more challenging with lots of room to learn and grow. I want more options for remote work in the future and a better salary upside. Already living in a tech hub, software engineering seemed like the clear winner. I'm working on creating a few small projects for my resume and prepping for data structures and algorithms portions of interviews. Is there more I should be doing though? I'm looking at roles outside of web dev so I'm focusing more on Python/Java language wise. Should I go back for a second masters/bachelors in CS or should I be fine with my current education (BS+MS Civil Engineering)?&amp;#x200B;I appreciate any advice or help!
owfbz5	1627913499	207	It’s been a hectic few months at work, with no foreseeable signs of slowing down in the near future, and it’s starting to take a toll on me. I didn’t really think too much into my whole situation until I started to see some changes in the way I acted. I won’t go into to much detail but bottom line is I’m not as productive as I used to be, and it’s making me frustrated and anxious at the same time. I take time off from work every now and then, and I still have my weekends, but it seems that taking time away just adds more to the pent up guilt of not being productive. For some reason as well, I’m not as calm and collected as I used to be. Things that normally wouldn’t bother me end up hitting me the wrong way now.Anyone else experienced this? If you’re currently in the same boat, have you figured out how to manage the situation?For what it’s worth, the work isn’t so bad, it’s just that I cannot deal with mediocre work and I feel like I have to set the bar high no matter what. I’m just worried it’s starting to spill over to my personal life.

oua9ew	1627606078	205	I am a later in life college grad-it took me 10 years because I was raising kids for the first part of my life. I did my practicum and internship at a private practice. I graduated with my masters in professional counseling and received my LPC associate license right as covid started. I worked in a residential facility for the first year then joined a private practice. I am burned out. I find I don't enjoy it like I expected. I do not enjoy the weight of carrying everyone's load (and since my friends and family all know I'm a counselor, I hear their stuff too). While the ability to choose my schedule is nice and I can take off when I want-i have no benefits, I don't have taxes taken out, and when I do take off work, I do not get paid. (Also I am limited -for now- to the state I am licensed in) I would like to find a career that I can enjoy. I am good at administrative tasks. My history before having kids was banking (teller), collections, payroll and light project management. I have been thinking about HR because of my psychology background. I would love any and all suggestions!

ou33a0	1627582853	129	I know it shouldn't be that big of a deal but oof that stings a bit. So far awaiting a response as to why, but I was wondering, would be better to do masters when getting into the biomedical engineering field to heighten my chances of getting a better pay as well as getting a job?Any tips and tricks to get an internship or should I shoot for a research position (I do love the lab)? Should I also TA/tutor in a related subject? Anything I should watch out for in job interviews?Also, I never had a semester break to myself since 9th grade so I'm planning to take one in the fall due to burnout (I am a senior now), will this hinder my chances of applying to internships/research/etc?
otekr6	1627493073	187	Ultimately my questions are:  How often do you have to work overtime?How often are projects dropped on your lap with tight deadlines?Do you or your PM ask for more time on projects?Background:I have worked as an MEP designer for 5 years now, but it is really starting to wear me down.  The anxiety of getting a crazy deadline dropped on your lap and the anxiety of meeting deadlines has caused me to suffer severe burnout, exhaustion, and depression at times.  I'm relied on very heavily to pick up the slack, but with no mistakes.  I'm often criticized when mistakes are made but the project is rushed with no review from the person sealing.Does this describe anyone elses career at any point, should i work for another firm?  I work from home so I'm afraid to give that up, but this position is very chaotic.  I often wonder if firms will be the same elsewhere too.It feels like owners are so demanding and that gets pushed all the way down to the MEP designer, all the responsibility, all the time, but no control...
otdmvn	1627490316	945	(Female, early 30s) I'm in a high-stress, demanding, non-profit director role. And a year in, I'm completely burned out. I'm deeply disappointed because I was so excited about this job. I care so much about the mission and have high expectations for myself. But there are other things I want to do in my life. I am more than this role. But this role has become my life and my identity. I've been burned out before, but this latest burnout has been a wake-up call. I think that I've gotten stuck in that trap of combining skills and passions into a career—and fallen into the cycle of nonprofit leadership burnout: Find a job you care about, go "all in," get burned out, find a job you care *even more* about, go all in, get burned out, and repeat. I'm once again questioning whether this career path is right for me. I have a nagging feeling I should just try having a "good enough job." Recently, I applied to and interviewed for one. Today I received the offer. It's a good offer, but it's a massive change. I would disappoint many people (myself included) if I take it. But long term, it could be a really good thing. I would have the time and energy to pursue my personal dreams—writing, creating, traveling, starting a family.I'm stressed about the offer though because it's all so sudden. They want to know ASAP (Monday). And if I say yes, they want a start date in two weeks. They were transparent about this in the interview, and I understand their reasons. But I'm in the midst of a huge work event this weekend followed by a conference next week. Even though I've spent weeks and months thinking about (even fantasizing about) this kind of opportunity, I hardly have time to think now that it's being offered. Also, as director, I feel guilty and bad about giving only two weeks to an organization I care so deeply about. A part of me would also LOVE a week off between jobs. I've always gone from one job to the next without a break in between. Another part of me is scared that if I take a week off, I'll have too much time to think and potentially regret my decision to leave the director role. It might be best to just jump in, especially when the new job would be less taxing and in itself be a mental, social, creative, emotional break. I've compared my current job and job offer below. To help me think this decision through, I'd love to hear if anyone has been in a similar situation. Especially if you identify as a multi-potentialite or "scanner." (I read Barbara Sher's book *Refuse to Choose* recently and can't stop thinking about it.)&amp;#x200B;|*Current Role*|*Job Offer*||:-|:-||Nonprofit executive director; small staff|Entry-level; part of a team||Decent salary, but frequently works 50+ hours, often nights and weekends due to meetings, events, and big projects|About $5K less, but a set schedule with normal hours||2 weeks PTO, but it's hard to take vacation due to workload, events, big projects, grants, etc. The PTO I do have has been more often used for sickness (due to stress) and needing mental health days. |3 weeks PTO. It's generous and the team is structured in a way that allows employees to take real time off.

If I leave now, I could eventually come back and volunteer for the org and still make a difference but on my terms—without sacrificing my life for it. ||I've only been here a year and started during the pandemic. What if I just need more time? What if I will settle in and find a good balance eventually?|It's been a long year. I only get one life.

ot4jbv	1627454681	359	On my 6th year of bachelor, played the whole change your degree game, still have no idea where my ship is headed.  I have 12 credits left until I graduate but when it comes to registering for the classes I just can't and have no interest in any class no matter how many times I review the catalog of classes my university provides.  It's making me sick to my stomach and I'm not excited to graduate at all, just seems like an "accomplishment" that I won't get any real fulfillment from.  I've heard the "just gotta do what you gotta do and finish" and "you're not the only one", but then what?  If I saw a career path or some kind of meaningful work at the end of this road I could probably stick it through but all I see is the examples around me which are people who already graduated and are just as lost and unfulfilled as I am, if not more.  I couldn't care less about a degree at this point, especially when all it gets you is debt and a JOB making no more than like 150k.  Not saying money is my goal, I'm saying why compete for 100-150k if you're just working and stressing yourself to burnout all the time anyway and the work you're doing is repetitive and/or meaningless?  These classes that I'm taking right now and will take if I sign up for classes, what is it really getting me?  is it worth being sad and frustrated over?  What are options if I drop out?  What if I don't, how can I bypass these credits so I skip ahead instead of running on the same rat wheel headed towards who knows where?  How do I find whatever it is out there that gets me going and feels like it's me?  I've taken career quizzes more times than enough, been to countless advising meetings discussing this, watched all the youtube videos, and read all your articles.  I don't know what else to do or where to go so here I am.
oshfuf	1627367275	361	Long story short, leaving my role after a decade, primarily due to burnout and secondly due to ex employer not being flexible around remote work. I have been a business analyst and most recently product manager in financial services and project managed major initiatives.  The burnout was diagnosed by a doctor, communicated to my employer and I took time off but the inference has been that I simply cannot handle the job despite us operating with 40% of our pre pandemic team. I stayed out of a sense of loyalty and it was a mistake. I've learned my lesson. I have enough money to survive a year, I have a secondary modest income from online personal training (I'm qualified), I cleared all debt so apart from rent and bills I've little outgoings, I live really modestly. I plan on spending two quality months with my wife and young baby as my wife is on maternity leave its a rare opportunity for us to be off together. Previous 12 hour days really impacted my time with baby and I want to rectify that. Luckily I have kept fit and physically healthy but plan on training more and walking a lot more with my child. I will build out my online training business a little more.  Tidy up the website and automate much of the process. This is a passion project for me and great learning. I plan on doing some of the free hubspot and Google courses as they are free and short to get me back into learning mode. I have a BA in Business, Grad Dip in Finance and also diplomas in Web Design and development.Ideally I want to take about 4 months off so I will start applying for jobs in about 8 weeks from my last day in my current role. I want as close to 100% remote work as I can get. I wanted to ask if there are any good companies, roles or courses I should consider? I've my cv updated and linkedin network is over 500 people. Also if I can reciprocate and help anyone here considering doing what I'm doing just shout. Thanks
os2csg	1627316977	120	I'm not at the stage of burnout that I can't come back from but if nothing changes in the next 2-3 years I will be there.  I love working with my hands, being creative and solving complex problems.  I long to be responsible for my own work, would like to retain some autonomy and would like to know what a weekend or holiday off feels like.  My dream job would be a secret lab in the basement of plano/ferno/akromills and work on ambulance design and equipment layouts but that aint happening.  So yea, any advice is appreciated and would especially like to hear from other Paramedics who did successfully transition to other non-healthcare related fields.  Thanks!
oq3t9n	1627051351	102	Preparing for an interview. One of my biggest gripes about my current job is how understaffed it is which makes the workload unreasonable. My current manager is ineffective and has only recently started advocating for more resources after several other employees followed up with me expressing concerns over burnout. I obviously am being picky about my next move and want nothing to do with this after having endured it for 3 years now. What can I ask the interviewer that will help me uncover whether this new opportunity suffers from the same issues without me asking seeming like a red flag to them?
oq3693	1627049404	760	Do what you love, they said. Find a job that combines your skills and passions, they said. That's the way to a purpose-filled life, they insisted. In the last decade, I've held several positions that others might consider "dream jobs." Jobs that combined my people skills and marketing background with my love of writing, design, and creating. I burn bright in the beginning—with each mission-driven job being a step up, a higher salary (and decent salaries for small non-profits), and a cause closer to my heart. But I've fallen into a cycle of burnout as I ultimately always find my creative, mental, social, and emotional energy being used up. Even though I'm an outgoing introvert, the endless meetings, volunteer management, events, and relationship-building drains my battery so completely that I spend all of my spare time recharging—with no social energy to truly spend quality time with my husband, friends, and family. Likewise, I have no creativity and mental capacity to indulge in my fulfilling hobbies—writing, art, history research. I've spent years building a career that commoditizes my creativity. Worse, I'm now in a position that truly makes a difference in my community. A year into it, I'm good at it. I know that I could be amazing at it. But the creativity it consumes, the social interaction it requires, and the long irregular hours and year-round event planning it demands are not sustainable unless I'm willing to sacrifice a lot of my personal life. I see now that Executive Director is not a job; it's a lifestyle. And I'm not sure it's right for me. I'm not sure I'm right for the role. (Or that I want to be right for it.)I stumbled upon Barbara Sher's idea of "the Good Enough Job" and other people's tales of giving up their "dream job" for a—for lack of a better term—"boring" job that leaves them with a reservoir of creative, mental, social, and emotional energy that allows them to truly do the things they love in their downtime. &gt;“If a job isn’t unpleasant, doesn’t eat up more than 40 hours a week, pays well, and provides security - it can give you the freedom to do all the things you love on your own time. People complain about unfulfilling jobs until they understand what the Good Enough Job actually is, and then they feel very different about them. Think of it as a job that doesn’t bother you, whose only crime is that it’s just not enough to fulfill your life. But it provides money and security and the freedom to fulfill your life in your free hours. That sounds like a great job to me.”   &gt;  &gt;\- Barbara Sher, *Refuse to Choose*The more I reflect on it, the more it makes sense to me. I think back to past jobs that might have been more mundane or less mission-driven. I might have been bored at times. Every job had its stresses and challenges. But in my past, more "good enough" jobs, I was at my most creative. I left my work at work. In my spare time, I was always doing what I loved. I ran a successful blog that I loved, but that also had the perk of bringing in a side income. I wrote creatively and made great progress on my novels. I dabbled in poetry and different arts for fun. I didn't love my job, but it paid the bills and allowed me to enjoy life outside of work—even if I made less money.I don't want to let people down. I don't want to disappoint the community that thinks I'm a perfect fit for my current position. I don't want to devastate the board and stakeholders who feel that I'm a godsend for the organization. (I'm a people pleaser and I'm feeling a lot of pressure.)  But I kind of just want to be a member of the community instead of a community leader.I want to do some kind of job that uses my other non-creative skills so that I can write and create to my heart's content after-hours.And I believe that with a "Good Enough Job" and creative fulfillment in my life, I'll ultimately have more to give to the community as a volunteer.I'm feeling very conflicted. I want to be brave and take the leap and see if a "Good Enough Job" would bring me more joy in my life. I realize this is a luxury and privilege to even consider making this choice.  Is there anyone out there who can relate?
opej3i	1626962854	120	Hi everyone! I left a position as a client relationship manager (CRM) in December of 2020 due to burnout (for some perspective within 3 months 3 other associates on my prior team of 12  also left). I am recently on the job hunt again and am feeling conflicted/lost. Dream job is corporate training (not industry specific) but unsure how to start in it. Would it be better to go back to previous CRM job and wait for a training position to open there since I’ll have hands on experience and time with the company? The CRM job was incredibly draining mentally and emotionally but a steady pay check and benefits. Unsure how else to get into training. Ideas are welcome!

The cause of my burnout is definitely my job since I don’t have time for anything else. The thing is - my doctor is on holiday and I’ll probably be able to get some sort of advice mid August. I am not sure if I should first take some time off before switching jobs or just start applying now?

So I craft my resume, put my transferrable skills and keep applying for jobs. I aimed for recruiting, training, HR and marketing (my least priority). After one month, I got an interview offer as a marketing manager. I was thrilled yet so lost. I have never really done any big marketing campaigns or channels and I can't think of how to answer the coming interview in 2 days. I did a research on the company (not much info and inactive website and social media accounts) and I found nothing about it. I don't want to miss the chance but I want to take the interview prepared. Can anyone in the industry please kindly suggest? Thanks a lot.

olai6x	1626413835	342	TLDR at the bottom. I have been at my job for 3 years now, started as an assistant very eager to learn and earn my spot in this place. Took on as much as I could to impress my peers and establish myself as an asset to the company. While I received much praise, I often found myself doing the jobs of others. I learned alot, but things started to snowball and I was constantly overwhelmed. My direct supervisor-but not manager was having me do all of his clerical duties and eventually most of his job. This turned from a great opportunity to a nightmare and things got worse during covid, when many were sent home to work remotely, while I stayed with the admin team to do the clerical things that remote workers couldnt. Our store eventually became very busy and I was constantly exhausted, overwhelmed and stressed out of my mind. Upper management stepped in when they noticed how much of other people's work I was doing. Earlier this year I was finally going to quit and just focus on my well-being, but an internal position opened up and I applied and got thw job. Three months into it I am still doing half my old job and part of my new job, since I was training my replacement and during the summer everyone has been going on vacation, leaving the rest of the team to fill the gaps. A solid 2-3 months of being at about 75% staff and overall tired and stressed. I dont want to take a vacation now, since we are finally getting to me being able to train for my new job, but lately I feel distracted, tired and unmotivated. Any tips? TL;DR Worked my ass off for 3 years, failing to set boundaries and constantly burntout/overwhelmed/stressed. Finally got promoted but feeling unmotivated and distracted because I have been overworked for some time. Need help dealing with burnout without going on vacation because I am finally getting to train on my new job after 3 months.
ol97rf	1626408533	413	Okay so, I don’t even know what I’m doing in life. I’m coasting I guess. I want a change. Here’s a little about me: -Live in Nashville, TN-I’m a 28 year old woman, married, have a 1 year old son -currently work as a sales coordinator at a hotel - I basically book groups and meetings and detail setup, etc. -before that, I worked as a guest service supervisor over the front desk, and before that I was a manager on duty. I worked my way up from front desk agent. Before that worked as a vet tech. -I never graduated college. Due to mental health issues, I attended several universities and dropped out several times. I don’t even have an associate’s. -I am now stable on medication and in a much better place to go back to school. Although with a child and full time job, it’ll be hard. Here’s what I’m looking for:-I just want a change. I want to help people. Or at least do something I’m passionate about. -I also can’t take a lower salary. I currently make about $45k and pursue anything less. Bills and such. -I considered nursing for a long time, but the more I read about it, the less I want to do it. I’ve heard the burnout is bad and nurses hate their jobs and end up quitting. -same thing about social work. -I don’t want to go back into the veterinary field either, I saw how much the vets I worked with hated it. -have been considering Healthcare management but don’t have any related experience other than working as a vet tech for a short time. Which is obvs not the same. Idk. I don’t hate my job but I also don’t love it. It’s tedious. I don’t want to do it for the rest of my working life. I know I have the possibility of working my way up from sales coordinator into more of sales management position, but without a degree it’ll take longer. And I just don’t really want to be in sales anymore. Is it worth it to just get my degree in anything, maybe something generic like business? Just to have it? Should I pursue healthcare management anyway? Is it even feasible to go back to school while maintaining a full time job and parenting my son? I’m so lost. Sometimes I just wanna quit and work on a farm or at the zoo or something. Ugh idk help?
ol08xl	1626377998	52	First gen college grad 8 years into my career—mostly public policy/nonprofit—and nowhere near where I want to be. My mental health is shot and has led me to make some questionable career moves as of late. Any advice? Do I just change careers at this point and if so what are my options?
ojkbl9	1626196990	230	25, been at a SaaS start up for nine months, I have been barely scraping by as an account executive when it comes to quota. Unfortunately, it is I’m getting worse as I am facing burnout and loss of passion. As the title reads I am a high functioning adult with AD and several learning disabilities. This is normally not an issue however there is times were communicating effectively or reading and writing at a fast pace becomes challenging. I have been somewhat successful throughout my professional career. 10 years in retail sales and now about two years in the corporate environment after graduation (criminal justice BA I don’t plan on using) Here’s the problem: I am not in the financial spot to afford a career coach or take time off to do some soul-searching to figure out my next move. I have limited time on my hands for applying to different positions but I’ve been making slow progress. My initial thought was to dive into sales ops or go into IT which I believe would be best to do for my personality. I do have basic computer skills such as Microsoft word Google suite, salesforce etc. But have no strong background in technical work. My only interest outside of work is fitness really however that would not apply to my professional career atm. Any advice or pointers would be appreciated.
ojid32	1626191291	109	A) Start Up in 10th year, looking to go public in 3-5 years. Tech, travel industry. Fun work environment, good benefits, good work culture, Remote, flexible hours, decent pay 50-80k.B) Large Corporate company, Remote, uncapped pay typically 70-100k first year, great benefits, not fun work environment, cold calling.I’m stuck between the two, the first job would most likely never amount to the same type of pay, but give me flexibility and I have a pt job lined up that is my passion. Job B is a great company with great benefits and money, could be an amazing career but is known for no work life balance and high burnout rate.
oiz59h	1626120128	298	I’ve been in my position for about ten months, and it was supposed to be my big “career” step up after finishing my master’s (had worked in admin support roles up until now). Long story short, I’m miserable and I’ve been miserable almost the whole time. I feel that the position was too big of a jump for me, and it’s doing a huge number on my self-esteem. I’m actively looking, but also feel I should have a come to Jesus conversation with my boss.Some of this is my own fault - I’m struggling with pandemic burnout/depression and am also pursuing assessment for ADHD, which I think it impacting my work. I probably could have been more proactive in asking for help/what I need. However, my boss has a million things on her plate and sometimes will take days to reply to an email. We had sporadic one on ones in my early months, but it’s been awhile since we’ve met. She is a very hands-off manager, I think due to her workload, and I’m not saying I want to be micromanaged but I also don’t feel I’m getting the support I need. Despite being ten months in, I still feel like I did on my very first day.Basically, even though I’ve decided this job is not a fit and am exploring other options, I also feel obligated to have a conversation with my boss about how I’ve been floundering, that way it’s at least on her radar. I just want to be sure to strike the right balance and not sound like a) I’m playing a blame game or b) I’m totally incompetent and they made a mistake hiring me (even though some days I feel that way!) Does anyone have any recommendations on how to approach this?
ohvquk	1625969128	260	Hello! 27 yo business worker— always have been in a role in the finance org, but was also a product mgr for a bit. I am struggling as I got a new job back in the business world due to burnout as a PM. Switched to a company with work-life balance, and overall less socialization with so many groups (feels less like every conversation is “selling” something). I loved learning about new tech and figuring out the link between systems to create a desired result as a PM (wasn’t the main part of my job though). I could really care less about the business side, unless it is finding out how to create some kind of model, or do an analysis to figure out the best result.I am now wanting to use more problem solving skills, getting my mind lost in the flow state of analytical problem solving and critical thinking. I also like business requirements and figuring out what those are, and how they need to work just by the stakeholders telling me the intended result. I guess I like systems thinking, meta data, figuring out the best fit for things, and just problem solving in general when it comes to technology, etc.Do you think an MS in computer science is a better fit, or an MBA with a specialization in marketing data analytics is a better choice? Is an MS in comp science (bridge program) worth the effort, or would my time be better spent on self-learning? Let me know any general thoughts you may have— much appreciated!Thank you!
oglqej	1625796103	298	I’m in the process of waiting to hear back from 3 out of the 6 jobs I applied to. They respond so slow. I want to know if I was denied or not. Should I email the first and second one? I don’t like the first one. Company seems like they have a lot of burnout. The other two are so low paying.(I also have a blog where I just started earning money from this week, so I’ll have two jobs.)These are the jobs that moved forward after application:1. Full-Time First job (nonprofit)•Pros: Great pay, lots of work experience, can get promoted fast•Cons: Way too many job tasks, they expect high quality work, very stressful, has several rounds of interviews, seems disorganized and really stressed being able to work in a fast-paced environment while multitasking Status: Did not respond to my thank you letter after interview, hasn’t said anything in two weeks2. Part-Time Second Job (university)•Pros: Pretty easy work, work from home, part-time, flexible•Cons: They look like a pretty low budget department, doesn’t really look like they know what they are doing, only 3 months long with possibility of 12 month extensionStatus: Hasn’t followed up over the past week after I submitted answers to their questions3. Full-Time Third Job (just got an interview request the day after I applied)•Pros: The perfect amount of work that I’d like to do, passionate about the company, culture and leadership, I have experience with them through my past company that worked with them•Cons: at the bottom percentile for salary for that job (nonprofit) and only very little higher pay than my last job, long commuteIt’s like either the company sucks and they have high pay or the company is amazing and they have low pay. 😩 I want some middle ground at least.
ogidv8	1625784284	678	Hi all,Sorry everyone, its a long one! I need some advice on whether I am making the right choice or will I end up kicking myself.After living in Canada for two years (2019-2021) I had to return back to the UK in June to wait for my Permanent Residency application to be processed in order to go back to Canada full time. So my plan was, get some random job in the UK, save money until my visa arrives and move back to Canada with some $ in the bank, and get back to work in the Film Industry (which is what I was working in before I left Canada)When I returned home to UK, I heard through an old college friend that a Commercial Photographer job had opened up at his company, which is a fairly prestigious sports brand here in the UK, shooting some incredible projects with big names / clients blah blah blah. I submitted my portfolio and have been shortlisted for the role. So things look somewhat promising. However, there are problems. At the moment the UK Driving Licence agency is severely back logged and I have not had my UK driving licence returned to me since being back in the UK (it could take potentially months until I get my licence back) - a driving licence is almost essential for this role due to adhoc / long working hours. There is no bus route that goes even close to this companies office - and using taxis from my house would cost me £18 per day! - this means I would be spending stupid amounts each day just to get to and from the office. (not to mention the random early and late hours leaving and getting back to the office on travel days to location shoots)Now, this is where the difficult decision comes in. I put my photography career on the shelf years ago. I wasn't particularly interested in pursuing Photography as a career again because I felt like I had lost the spark and hunger for it. However, the hope of landing this job and working with their client roster has made me question if i should give it one last shot. My brother used to work for this company and said the burnout rate is very high on the creative team because of their workload and crazy  hours / travel (both in UK and international) so, burnout plus expensive / difficult commuting logistics has me thinking that I should take the other, safer opportunity I have been offered...A company I used to work for has offered me a safe, (easy commute) office job that will pay me pretty damn well. Its routine hours, normal office job ya know. This job will give me a solid wage, , great relationship with former colleagues, good environment, great opportunity to hunker down and save $ for when I get back to Canada. And I can start next week- In fact, I have to say YES to the job by next week else ill lose it.  Whereas, the photographer job may still be 3-4 weeks out before I start... IF im even successful in getting the job?bearing in mind going back into photography wasn't even on my radar until this potential job came up, am I better just taking the safe job that's been offered to me here and now. And then, if I start kicking myself for not taking the 'exciting / creative / very well paid photographer job' I can refocus on that when I get back to Canada.Ive always been reluctant and wary of office jobs, I think they destroy souls. And if I wasn't waiting to go back to Canada and carry on in Film industry I wouldnt be looking to go back to an office.  Am I stupid to give up on this photography job and take the 'safe' office job - even though my priority is saving money to get back to canada once my Visa lands on my doorstep. &amp;#x200B;I hope this makes sense! Thanks all!
ogg5yk	1625777431	216	Has anyone ever had a burnout from working in a bar/restaurant? Since I've gone back to work after the pandemic I'm dealing with chronic back pain and I work a mix of days and nights. My sleep is all over the place and I constantly feel tired and angry. I come home wrecked dying to sleep but can't and in the morning it's a struggle to get up. On my days off Im too tired to do anything and just nap intermittently during the day. I get sleep paralysis at least three times a week lately (never had it this much) and get electric shock sensations in my face and hands during the day. Has anyone else had this?I really want to leave but it's complicated. I'm trying to get away from bar work with freelance copywriting. It's going well but working as a copywriter is a long term goal and not something that can provide a consistent wage right now. In the meantime I have had four days off sick last month and I'm scared to go sick again but I feel my anxiety/panic attacks issues coming back hard and it's a bit scary. I genuinely feel I need this time to myself but I'm scared of the consequences from my employer. What should I do?
og30x9	1625732758	130	Early Childhood Education:Pros — Making a difference in children’s lives, not your typical 9-5, summers off, love spending time with children and teaching, active career, more specific route Cons — pay isn’t that great, burnout factor is high, children are exhausting, you cannot afford to have a tired day behind a desk while quietly getting your work done because you constantly have to tend to the children. Communications with a concentration in photography or journalism or graphic design: Pros — endless job opportunities, better pay, able to work your way up in positions, can do multiple kinds of jobs at once, can hone my creativity, can be more independentCons — typical 9-5, extremely broad career path, hard to narrow down what it is I want to doThanks for reading! Feedback appreciated.
ofyxul	1625714886	335	Hello all I will start with the backstory to my question.I got lucky after college and landed in a small lab. Everything was going great, I was growing and learning quickly. However, slowly things started to change. After a year our supervisor was let go with no replacement. This left our department technically understaffed, so 2/3 people. The position was never filled and a promotion was never offered. The work was now on me and another person to fulfill. The work was difficult to complete, but it was done on time with long work weeks for the both of us. Fast forward a year the person I worked with, after my supervisor was let go, got a promotion into a different area. Also our manager put in their notice. This much knowledge leaving the department was detrimental.  We hired a new person, but learning the job takes time. I took the bulk of the work as I could process it faster with less errors. With our biggest season ahead, the amount of work is too much for one person, being me. I did raise concerns about the work not being completed as time went on, there is simply not enough hours in the day for the volume. However, nothing was accommodated. I still tried and gave more than 100% every day, but I could never catch up. Today I have officially burnout. I just can no longer produce the type of quality work that I am proud of, and simply can't keep up. I tried setting up a vacation to help with the burnout, but my request was ignored. I decided I would put in my two weeks. I found a part time job, but it is in retail specifically Apple. I feel so completely lost with this step back. I was wondering if anybody else went through a situation like this? I have applied for other similar jobs however the job market in my region is too small for these types of jobs. Thanks!
ofukgs	1625699550	648	I think I need career advice to try to see things from a different perspective and think of alternatives.For context, I am an experienced 33M software engineer, married, no kids, immigrant living in the Netherlands. In 2019 I had my first very serious burnout and had to quit my job to try to recover.8 months later, due to financial needs and feeling ready, I got back into the tec industry. I got a great job as a software engineer in one of the biggest companies in the Netherlands, with excellent salary and benefits. A few months later my nightmare started all over again. A completely broken and toxic team, people literally crying in meetings (I had never seen anyone really cry at work), endless meetings, and a lot of work for a very small team.I was desperate and burnout was only a matter of time. I really didn't want to go through it all again. Aware of this I started to look for a new job, and after 9 months working in this toxic place, I finally got an offer to work at a local startup. They agreed to pay me a little more in salary to compensate for the benefits I was giving up.The joy did not last long. I worked only 11 days at this new company and they fired me saying that I was not a good fit for the position. At my dismissal which was during an online meeting, I felt that they were not being honest with me, I wanted to really understand why I was being fired with so little time, but I received only generic answers. I guess the director didn't like my face or I showed signs of burnout and they wanted to cut me off early on. I will never know the truth. It was very hard. I was back to zero, unemployed again.After this disappointment, in 2021, I decided to dedicate myself to side projects and entrepreneurship. I was no longer willing to endure so many frustrations in the technology industry. I created a YouTube channel that today has a few hundred subscribers and I work with some digital products, which despite being promising, still generate a very small amount of money. I am sure that if I keep working on this I will increase my income, but YouTube is something that takes a lot of work and time to grow.Today, 6 months after I was fired, I am living off my savings account, which will run out at the end of this year, and of my wife's income, which is also very small. So I need to do something.I am completely lost. I would love to have a part-time job that would give me an income to live off of, without taking all the time that I use for my YouTube work, but I have no idea what.I'm afraid to go back to working as a software engineer which is what I've always worked as, and have burnout again. In my mind, I would rather deliver food or any other type of work than go through what I went through again.Another option would be to work as a freelance software engineer but I have never done that before and don't even know where to start.What do you advise?Really appreciate the help.TL;DR: I'm an experienced software engineer, had a serious burnout that took 8 months to recover. I got back to work after that, worked 9 months on a terrible toxic company, and started to look for a new job again. I was hired in a local startup, left the toxic company, worked on this startup only 11 days, and got fired. Now I am unemployed and wondering whether I should try once again to find a job as a software engineer, or become a freelance, or work part-time delivering food while dedicating myself to my promising YouTube channel.
ofpjns	1625684268	97	So,  it's taken me this long to find out what I could probably tolerate  doing as a career, and that's being a private investigator.However,  I've never gone to school and I'm really overwhelmed with the process,  and I'm currently not working and my job prospects aren't very good, so  I'm looking for a way I might be able to go back to school and just  focus on school itself.Supposed  to be attending a seminar tomorrow night regarding non-trad students and  scholarships and the like, but I'd really like some advice.

ofmo02	1625675973	327	I work as a project manager, mostly to bring data projects to life &amp; increase visibility of various metrics. My company is trying to be data-driven, but the problem is that our processes &amp; systems don’t create easily-accessible or usable data sources that can be used to make operational or strategic decisions. It’s a 24/7/365 operation, so there’s never any downtime to implement extensive improvements. On the one hand, the company has been incredibly supportive through COVID, and I truly want to build a career here. Part of me would love to build a role for myself in pushing the company to address some of the problems it has with data, developing a data strategy &amp; standardizing our approach to data. I generally love being a PM and look forward to new projects. …But the day-to-day is incredibly dysfunctional. I’m currently working on a project with the IT department, and have been going in circles with various team members for weeks. Finally, the director of IT got on a call and got some answers… by asking the *exact. same. questions.* I’ve been asking for the past 2 weeks. And this is a trend I see with lots of my other project: the operation takes priority, and I don't have enough pull to get people moving on projects. What’s more, the most recent direct managers I’ve had have been much less supportive in helping me realize my long-term goals. (I lucked out with the first two, who really advocated for me and put me in front of leadership.) I’m happy to put in the leg work, but I’m wondering if it’s a matter of diminishing returns &amp; whether I should start looking for another role. I’m really hoping people here have advice on steps to take to address this burnout, &amp; whether the devil I know is better than the devil I don’t. (&amp; if I do decide to leave, how do I keep my sanity in the short-term?)
oenfpa	1625544673	386	My only goal is to be financially independent and stable, and avoid burnout and the seemingly inevitable Americana “I hate my life I hate my job” cliche. I’m very artistic I love and have a talent for visual arts as well as reading/writing. I’m very much a bookworm I read a variety of fiction/non fiction/psychology/research/essays etc. and have taken art classes all through out school. I don’t think I’d ever want my main profession to be centered around my hobbies but something that includes those things could be nice. I love working with children more than anything, and could see myself being an elementary teacher but I’m not sure how I’d like that for a long term job due to the salary. I’ve thought about being an art therapist or pay therapist specializing in working with children but I want to know more about what jobs I could get doing that and if I could specialize working with children suffering from physical illness, or abusive households. I have anxiety disorders myself so I worry about being a therapist and being surrounded by triggering stories frequently. It’s difficult for me to work with adults but I always feel most comfortable with children. A career where I feel fulfilled by doing something enjoyable and impactful that doesn’t really feel like work is a dream for me. I’m actually a trained and certified Doula because the thought of just being around women and babies all the time seemed so wonderful, but I’ve since had a change of career plan as that is more of a side job and you focus more on mom rather than baby. I’m thinking a career in education or brain science, (focused on children) but I’ve also had interest in working in museums as a curator or coordinator of some sort for children as well (not sure what’s available for that) I hear a lot of stories about people who end up working at a non profit with certain degrees in what I’m interested in and are able to work with underprivileged or Ill children which is something I’d like to do. I’m taking a gap year to figure things out before I go to university so I’m trying to kinda plan out my vision for my future. Any ideas on a career for me ?
oe2335	1625470066	208	Hi all, currently going thru a mid 20s existential crisis. Mental health is just deteriorating. Not seeking pity, just guidance. I have a bachelors in biomedical sciences 17' no experience with the degree whatsoever. Initial plan was to go to PA school. Applied last year, didn't get in. Racked in some debt for not getting in. This past December I decided to take it as a sign and go premed instead. Recently Realized that I don't want to be a doctor due to the stress,overwork, burnout. I realized it was more of the pressure of being first generational college grad to become one. I just want to be happy and financially comfortable and secure while being able to travel. I have a CNA license in FL, extreme sh** pay but it was based off getting experience needed for PA school. Current thought process: 1. Apply to jobs within my field (but Ive only seen $15hr for a bachelors what most companies on indeed seek for:( )2. Apply to accelerated nursing and get my RN degree and be a travel nurse and eventually work my way to CRNA 3. Join the national guard as an officer due to my degree any advice is welcomed as well as prayers. Thank you.
odstb2	1625431966	585	I work in tech and have worked at a few other companies prior to this. I'd say I'm a type A personality and am extremely goal/accomplishment oriented.**Situation:**Never been in this situation before. In this company, I've done well in perf reviews and have respect across several different orgs in the company. Outside of work or anything non-work related, my manager, X, is really nice. Anything work related is a completely different situation. A few observations:\- places high value on friendship at the workplace. Being friends with X is like a get out of jail free card. People can turn things in late, submit half-assed work, etc.\- hired someone into the group with a title of high seniority despite not having the experience to back it; I ended up needing to train them almost from scratch. Nothing was done when it was mentioned and shown that this person was not suitable for the job; I then needed to take over their work because it was bogging me down big time. They knew each other well outside of work\- previous hire was not equipped to do the job; after mentioning this to X with no resolution, I had to heavily coach them and take over their work until they left\- A few hires in other groups that X made were very questionable, also noticed by others\- Not fast enough to address toxic staff issues; certain people were blatantly toxic, and too many chances were given. They knew each other before\- Never gives feedback; I'm far from perfect and it's impossible that there's nothing I need to work on\- I mentioned I was on the verge of burnout and likely going to leave after numerous months of long hours and weekends and nothing was done. Not even a "how can we fix this" chat that I would do if I were in X's shoes.\- I feel like decisions that X sometimes makes are watered down to appease everyone instead of doing what's right despite being slightly painful. Feels like the Roman emperor doing what the crowd wants him to do at the coliseum from the scene in Gladiator.\- X is slippery when trying to pin down specifics. I wanted to see if I was underpaid based on my output and title, but X said they didn't know those details and only spoke in generalities. This seems pretty unlikely considering X is the one that hands out raises and determines starting salaries. Also, never brought up where I want to see myself in the company and how to get there.\- Seems to have a very "stay in your lane" mindset with management despite it being potentially incredibly important to the org\- X strikes me as someone who tries to be an individual contributor instead of a manager, despite the large lack of knowledge and experience. It's frustrating constantly having to correct/call them out on the simplest of things.\- X prefers chaos and being reactive, as opposed to planning and proactive. The lack of planning def trickles down to my team. If I'm not carefully watching X and attending every meeting, it can mean a lot of scrambling for us.Job function, salary, location, some aspects of the work experience are positives, but X and work life balance is def a negative; X is too deeply embedded into the org to go anywhere as well.I've never actually had a good manager, but do you think X is a weak manager? Have you been in this situation, and how did you fix it?
obsyn9	1625166951	366	 I have been saving money since before I started this job and before covid so I could take a long international trip (which I’d have taken by now without covid being a hurdle). I have about 3 weeks of vacation leave saved up and I want to use it all at once to get a long travel break, but I’m afraid my boss won’t approve it. I tried to use 2 weeks PTO in March bc of burnout, let my boss know months in advance, and submitted the leave request over a month in advance, but she told me a week before my time off start date that they probably wouldn’t approve it and I ended up only taking 2 days. I’ve worked at this job for over a year now and I have taken TWO vacation days.Now covid restrictions are slowly lifting globally and I want to start planning my trip a few months out, but I’m afraid my boss won’t approve 3 full weeks of PTO, especially if they wouldn’t even approve 2 weeks during a slow period. I work as a financial aid counselor so I get it, they need me, but I need myself and my time to perform best.What can I do to make sure I can take my trip and use my PTO if anything? I don’t get paid enough at this job to sacrifice all my energy and youth to it without ever taking a break. I see colleagues taking week-long breaks often but bc I’m a counselor and they’re short-staffed, I work like a dog. Not being able to use my PTO after all this work seems so disheartening. I feel trapped at this job and in the US. I just want to go drink some good ole European beer and slum it up in hostels with no worries for a while. Sometimes I daydream that if my boss doesn't approve this leave request, I immediately forward my resignation letter citing the rejection of leave with ample advance as one of my main grievances. Please help me if you have experience with this! Or make me feel a little better by also complaining about your leave request rejections.
objphd	1625138453	158	I've been working at my current job for a little over two years now. Since then, I have experienced alarmingly high turnover including multiple direct managers, a skeletal department that conflates its roles onto one person, toxic gossipy behaviors, and so on. Since then this job has contributed to horrible burnout and anxiety/depression. I actively dread waking up every morning to go to work, especially because my role expanded to something I didn't initially hire for and I barely got a pay bump. I know it's dicey leaving without a backup, but I currently don't have that much in bills I have to worry about and I have a great amount of money saved up. I'm confident I wouldn't be out of a job for that long, but still, it's a risk. This job is making my life miserable and I can't take it...it's THAT bad. Has anyone been in my situation and walked without a backup lined up?
ob6yvp	1625088341	617	Hi, I'm a healthcare worker currently juggling several jobs and offers looking for some advice. This is kind of long, thanks for bearing in advance.After moving counties, I left my previous job without fully knowing that my newer position (we'll call job A) is *very* per diem, ranges from 0-5 hours a week. This was a couple of months ago so I frantically started applying to lots of places and now I'm stuck deciding between several positions, which would be a good problem to have, except none of them offer consistent hours and I'd probably be wasting a sizable amount of time on unpaid driving and organizing my schedule.I have two 1099 positions where I drive to people's homes to see patients - job A is the very low hours per diem job listed above, and I just started job B that offers in home and some virtual work. It is implied for job B that I try to retain the patients until their contracts expire (ranges from 6 mo to 2 years), but I just got offered another clinician's clients so I'm guessing it isn't set in stone.Not long after starting job A, I accepted a w-2 per diem position (job C) since I was desperate for work, which is about 1-2 hours a week, but I have to waste time driving across the county to see the patient. Yesterday, I got another w-2 per diem offer (job D) that is very similar to job C, 1-2 hours a week, but pays a little better and will try to assign me closer to my area. By the end of today I have to respond to a different offer (job E) for a w-2 part time job at a clinic that would be more consistent and stable with potential to turn to full time depending on caseload, their needs, and if its a good fit for us both.As you can see, this is a mess lol I regret not just looking for full time work initially, but with COVID, opportunities were scarce and are now finally getting a little better. I was also afraid of burnout with full time positions, which is not uncommon in my job depending on the setting. I can only rationalize by saying I tried not to settle for something I knew I'd hate and tried my best with the opportunities available in my area at the time.My current plan is to stay with all of these jobs (still deciding on D) and just schedule them for different days by area for at least 3-6 months since I already dug myself in this hole. Does anyone else juggle multiple jobs and/or freelance work? Any tips or advice for managing your schedule besides using calendars and trying to group by geographic location?I applied to 2 full time jobs awhile back with larger organizations that are slower and I might hear back from them later, but of course no guarantee on whether I'll get them. So I'm wondering, how soon is too soon to leave some of these positions if I get offered something full time that I either really like, pays better, and/or has benefits? Should I just stop applying to full time jobs and accept/work with my situation for at least 6 mo?I feel like I shouldn't need to feel tied to any of these since I'm either not legally an employee or I'm barely working for them at all. But on the flip side, I don't want to be unprofessional and flaky by leaving soon, given most of them have been pretty nice to me and this is more of my fault. Any help or input would be greatly appreciated - thank you!!
oadrsv	1624990006	240	I have been working for 3 years 6 months, first 2 1/2 years I was working full time while studying part time university, which has been physically and mentally exhausting, but the work culture was great. After my graduation, I decided to change my job to try something new, but related field as my previous job. I have been here for 6 months, and feel that I have been miserable from the start till now. My boss is a difficult person to work with, not considering work boundaries, i.e, calling after working hours, hinting me to work when i'm on leave. We have a monthly catch up where we talk about my progress, and he'll always highlight my flaws and things I need to improve on, even on qualities that I feel that it's my strong points. I slowly began feeling insecure and doubtful of my capabilities and whether I'm able to deliver my work, and the doubts and insecurity manifested where I feel that I'm really unable to perform.Under the encouragement of my other half, I went for my first therapy session last week because of my job. I'm still on the same job now as it's only been 6 months, but I already feel burnout, drop of confidence and doubts on my capabilities..I guess I'm trying to ask if anyone went through a similar problem before, what they did to manage it.. and does a break help with it?
o9wwyq	1624925808	357	30 F. British, living in USA. Hi everyone. I have been in comms and marketing in creative agencies and now in house for last 10 years. I have had the chance to work with some of the worlds best brands &amp; travel the world. I’m super fortunate and I’ve loved my career. Now, I have a great role in house at a massive consumer company in San Francisco. But. I have lost every ounce of motivation, love and care that I once had. I’ve worked so hard to get to where I am and realize this could be burnout. But I can’t make myself care anymore. On paper I have a role anyone would be envious of and that has amazing progression opportunities. But…. I’m so disenchanted with it all. Like the whole corporate culture, endless meetings, constant talking (no doing), the ‘working for a man for a paycheck until you die’ vibe. I’m over it and everyday is harder to give a f*ck. Obviously this is going to affect my work eventually, more than it is already (I generally hide it well)Most days are spent day dreaming about what else I could do, but then telling myself those options aren’t available to me. I’m not good enough to start my own business for example, and cannot take the risk to leave a good and stable salary when I live in the most expensive part of the world and my partner does not earn enough for us to live on his salary.Also I should add. Being forced back to the office hasn’t helped. This corporate bullshit mentality is so backwards. I can work from anywhere, why am I killing my self to line someone else’s pockets ?Or am I being ungrateful? Should I be grateful to have a job in this climate with opportunities etc? I just don’t know anymore. I want to go live in a cabin in the woods. Is it a phase? How do I get myself out of this funk? I barely have the motivation or energy to write an email let alone start my own thing. But I can’t stop. Please help 😥

o9uf2c	1624917506	225	I work 37h a week (full time) Monday to Friday. I have recently discovered a consulting opportunity I can pursue, to control my own work and hours, but it has to be done outside of my normal working hours. I had a burnout last year because I overworked in my ft job, but now I got much better with boundaries and doing ok. I did freelance work on the side (albeit that I didn’t enjoy very much) and quit as I found it too stressful to work with their deadlines (I was a translator). Now I want to help charities with project management, something I’m super passionate about and it’s a topic I can talk about for ages (also my day job is a project manager in a charity). I can’t see why it would be stressful as as I mainly see myself learning about them and working out solutions to their problems, training them. It will also benefit my ft work as I’ll be learning lots.I wonder if any of you have any success stories of combining ft work and side hustle? For reference I don’t have children and my time outside of work is pretty much my own (no other commitments) but I like to keep weekends work-free if I can help it, with an occasional half a weekend spent on work-related reading etc.
o9b2r5	1624847337	193	Im currently 18 and a female that just recently graduated high school and i have been experiencing some burnout/stressful/depressive/frustrated feelings and have also been feeling kinda sad because of this. Like ive been pressured to choose a career and you know how people and teachers are like "what are you gonna do? Where you headed?" And everytime i hear that question i answer them with like different choices first was being a cosmetologist, then diet tech, then I changed to accountant and those are the few i told them. But anyways, i don't know what to do cause I feel like im wasting time and some of the things I want in a career are that it doesn't take so much time to learn but also pays well but also isn't stressful and be flexible is there any job like this?? My brother says do something i enjoy but I don't really know what...? Sorry if that sounds strange. I have very bad anxiety and like i said im a female so i can't really do a lot of heavy lifting because im like 4'11 and really short so 😔 im just sad. Thanks
o80124	1624666934	1580	I (28m)got a new job two years ago as a housing officer housing vulnerable people and low to moderate income families in Ireland. It started off well, I got promoted, my salary is very high for a recent graduate in Ireland.But for the last few months I’ve become extremely angry, frustrated and overwhelmed with my work. I’m filled with a tremendous form of anger at my tenants and what I have to  deal with. Intellectually I understand that they are in difficult circumstances but emotionally it’s very trying.  I don’t know how to deal with this anger. Everything  to do with my job makes me so frustrated. I’ve tried mindfulness, exercise and I’m starting to think that the only effective intervention will be leaving the job.I hate the job but it has its rewarding aspects. It can be rewarding housing vulnerable people and it can be interesting the different things that happen. It’s also extremely financially rewarding.I just took this job because I didn’t know what else to do after college. My original plan was to do this for 2-3 years and then do something new. I needed work experience and I thought this role would give me an amazing amount of experience. I always knew it would be tough but I thought having lots of cash and travelling would make it bearable. Unfortunately Covid ruined my travel plans and my life became consumed with work. I have no idea what else I would do and it took me nearly a year to get this job. I hate the idea of having to go through the job search again and I don’t know if I’d find something that will pay like this again that easily with my education and experience.My dream is to hopefully work at something creative and I work on that in my spare time and I’ve been very diligent about that. Id like to go back to college and do an mfa in a few years in a different country and live abroad again when covid is over. I don’t know if my dream will ever work out or pay the bills. I haven’t a clue what I’d do to pay the bills but I am lucky enough that I could afford to go back to colleges to retrain if I wanted. But I don’t know what I’d retrain in or study.Part of me is like I  should just drop out of society, work on my goals full time and  live off my savings for a year. I think I might do that when covid is over. A strong part of me thinks I should just keep doing what I’m doing till I’m vaccinated and covid is not a crisis anymore. I can’t figure out what to do. I earn 42k year but I also receive travel expenses and that regularly brings my take home pay to 3-4K a month. My degree was a basic psychology degree. I have nearly 40k saved already. If I stay in the role about year I could save another 10-15k or even more.My family has a second house they used to rent and I live there now so my expenses are very low. I don’t pay rent and I’m set to inherit this home. I’m extremely privileged and very appreciative of that considering my line of work.My job has always been highly pressurised and has only continued to get more stressful during covid. I’ve made a big impact at work and I’m very good at job which has lead to me getting more and more new housing estates. I’m getting paid more to travel to them but there is enormous amount of work involved in setting them up. I’m essentially doing two jobs at the moment. My role has multiple levels. I’m essentially a property manager, a social worker, a landlord and rent collector. It’s been extremely demanding dealing with clients with mental health difficulties, addiction issues,anti-social behaviour whilst trying to house over a 100 new tenants during a pandemic.Every time I try to focus I get a call or email and I can’t always ignore them, meaning my priorities shift. I can’t always plan ahead because my role is responsive to the need of my vulnerable tenants I can’t plan.Everyone at work, management and staff say I have an incredibly large work load at the moment and it’s been like that for the past 18 months.I like my management and the people I work with aside from the clerical staff who I don’t think take on enough administrative work. I’ve complained to my management that I end up doing too much administrative work and that I would be more effective if I could focus on the core aspects of my role and not doing tedious clerical work when there is other people around to do it. Naturally there has been a lot of push back to me doing this.My managers management don’t care about us frontline workers and just want to see more houses filled and low arrears. They push more work on us and while my immediate manager protects us there is little they can do as they are under serious pressure themselves.My colleagues who do the same role as me have all reported feeling burnt over and overwhelmed. However they don’t have the same amount of new estates that I have as they have been doing this way longer than me. Unfortunately for me they had far more supports available to them when they were setting up their estates.This week my colleagues and I spoke to our head manager and reported our concerns and he said that they will try to fix some of our issues. However it remains to be seen if change will come.I pushed for change so I think I should wait to see if it comes before quitting then. I just don’t know if I can.I feel overwhelmed, exhausted and angry all the time. I’ve never experienced such anger before and I’m afraid of who it’s turning me into.I can’t reason myself out of the feelings I have. It’s completely physical.I’m exposed to a lot of negativity and complaining. About 50% of the complaints I receive are tenants moaning about silly things there neighbours did or something minor not working in their house.The other 50% are serious complaints about addiction issues and mental health issues. Because I’m trying to do various projects these calls are essentially major distractions for me.I just don’t care and I’m physically and emotionally burnout. I was ordered to take two well being days off this week because I’m so overwhelmed. I’m making stupid mistakes at work and I have aches all over my body.I’m not afraid of being fired. Right now things are so busy they need me.My manager asked me to come in today to come up with a plan to tackle the remaining projects I have left. They are going to help split my workload and said they’ll help me. I was very honest with her and my head manager.I’m thinking about quitting and I’m exhausted and frustrated. I told them I don’t think I want to quit right now( I do want to quit but I don’t know if it makes sense to do it right now when I could endure more and leave next year) but that I’m afraid if I continue like this I’ll have no choice. I told them that I’m not going to be very effective right now as it’s difficult to even get off couch.They are being very supportive but I don’t know if I have it in me to do this anymore. Like physically and emotionally can’t do it anymore.I need a big holiday but I’m so close to finishing that if I went on holiday right now  that I’d just be ignoring these issues. What I’m dealing with right now is extremely time sensitive and if the work is shared I think it can be sorted in July.I feel very vulnerable right now and I just can’t face dealing with clients. I checked one email today and one client was complaining and threatening to report me like They always do. A lot of the issues I deal are very minor but I can’t take the entitlement and negativity anymore from some of my more middle class tenants.Everyday I’m fighting or arguing with someone and it’s draining being in aggressive situations all the time. Im starting to hate humanity.I have nearly a year salary’s saved, near 40k. I have no responsibilities or debts.If this was pre covid I would have said fuck it and gone travelling to further figure out what I want. But I can’t do that.I’m not depressed. I’m just stressed out, overwhelmed and very very angry. I don’t like feeling like this anymore. I haven’t hurt anybody or done anything drastic with my anger but I’m afraid that I’m gonna have an outburst if this continues.TLDR;How can I get deal with this anger?Should I quit or see it out for another year like I originally planned and wait for covid to end?My management has offered help so I should see what happens?I’m leaning towards staying with a view to quit in a year. There is a possibility things will get a little better  when things are settled and I’ll grow more resilient as well.I just don’t know if I’m able to hold out . My whole body aches and I’m exhausted.
o7axiq	1624575341	184	Hi everyone.I’m pretty sure that I’m mid-burnout at my current job (in communications) - the company is dysfunctionally organised, work is disproportionately given to me rather than other team members and my boss is hardly present in management terms. It’s causing me a huge amount of stress and I need to make a change of some kind.Coincidentally I’ve just been asked to interview for a role by a contact at another company - it’s a similar job and will still be high pressure but I would guess that it would be better managed and without much of the dysfunction present in my current job.I guess what I’m asking is whether the change in itself will be enough to solve feelings of burnout, or should I be looking for either some time off or a role that is less demanding and high pressure in order to ‘recover’? The potential new role is a really good opportunity but I don’t want these feelings I’m having to get any worse, and the pressure of a new job may exasperate rather than reduce them.Interested to hear what people think.
o70jx3	1624540196	403	Hi all, in need of some advice, especially from people in IT positions or who have been in IT positions.I am self-taught Linux/Cloud admin, I have studied something completely unrelated in uni and then moved to IT - Mainframe first, until I've decided Linux is just more relevant and moved there about 3 years ago. My current employer hired me as a junior and I've been very grateful, however there are many problems within the company that made things very difficult, like lack of knowledge transfer practices, lack of structure and standardization, and just bad planning or lack there of, whether that'd be in personal growth or project management. So I got stuck, I haven't developed many new skills, haven't developed confidence in the position, and was just tossed from one thing to another. One day it was Kubernetes, next day it was Ceph, next day AWS, then image build and all with constantly changing software. So I have a mash of random knowledge on different Linux and Cloud technologies, but nothing that would get me hired. Not to say that I definitely don't have any options, few companies have offered me positions, but I had to decline due to them offering even lower salary than I earn now or due to my perception of the team having very similar problems that mine has now (hiring without knowing what they expect out an employee or having a vision for the team).  I'm in a pretty bad burnout from trying to absorb way too much information or information that is too challenging without certain fundamentals, lacking any reward of finishing tasks because there is just no structure in the team: something I have started will be picked up by someone else without me getting a chance to have some time to investigate and learn and finish it.So I am open to any advice on how to move forward! Where do I start? Do I focus on Linux because that seems like a less chaotic path and maybe get an Red Hat Engineer certificate and then look for a Linux position? Or is it possible at all to get into Cloud without being completely overwhelmed, maybe start with AWS and only then with Kubernetes, Terraform, OpenStack from scratch? If you have felt similar in an IT career what did you do? What advice could you give? Any thoughts that came up reading this, please share.
o6kiqc	1624477879	343	Hi career guidance gang,I got a job because of the benefits, travel, and getting my master's paid for. Because of covid, all of the reasons I joined became obsolete or have returned with extreme restrictions. I'm being trained but no one has "claimed" me. I'm not under anyone specifically resulting in me working across multiple teams. My boundaries for workloads are never respected; I have been treated poorly for attending funerals, being sick, and being attentive to my certification classes. At first, I thought they were treating me as if I was on the same level as my superiors, but now I realize my place of work is misusing the people in training as full workers because our hours are billed differently.I can genuinely say that this job has made me truly miserable. It's a great career but not for me. I only planned to give this job a decade but I'm becoming worn down after the mistreatment. I plan on entering a doctoral program 1-2 years from now and want to get a letter of recommendation from my current job. My dilemma is that I'm becoming more and more of a burden as I burn out. **I want to finish my training program but I don't believe I can finish strong. When is the best time to quit?**Exit strategy details: My lease is up in December which is also my 2-year mark. I have \~8k and have next to no bills (mint mobile and car insurance). I plan on moving back in with my parents to start over (yes they are fine with it lol). The new jobs I'm looking at pay a little less than what I currently make but are actually in the field I want to be in. I plan on learning more about the field before I get my doctorate. My goal is to will save up before applying and get more connections/recommendations for my application.&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;TL;DR Got a job for all the wrong reasons and am experiencing burnout. How do I quit and still maintain connections for future endeavors?
o66an5	1624425739	402	I've loved art since a young kid. So much so that I decided later in 8th grade to go to college for it, majoring in Graphic Design. Along the way I gained debt of course, thinking at least I'd be able to make a living generating "useful" albeit commercial art (websites, branding, 3d animation, motion graphics etc.) I figured if I could get paid to do something I love, go for it.Since graduating in 2013, I've worked 2 professional jobs for a total of over 7 years of experience. Last July I was laid off, and in reflecting on my situation I'm realizing I've lost my passion. It may be a bit of imposter syndrome, even though I've always been told I have talents in this area. I feel painted into a corner in the sense that I've gone into debt for something that I don't get a thrill from anymore, when I observe art or design in the world I'm no longer inspired at all. I feel desensitized by the repetition. Some people do things they love and the more they do it, the more in love they become. For some reason, it's the opposite in this case. I think it's a bit of PTSD from past jobs and the conditions/environments and expectations that left me with a bad taste.My question is: have any fellow creatives felt this feeling or experienced this? It seems like a fork in the road — I could go back to working a design job, but something tells me I'd despise and doubt it several times per hour while doing the work. I don't even want to sit behind a screen for 8 hrs anymore, and I want to do something meaningful that doesn't add to the noise (sure, good causes can use advertising and new creative work, but they rarely pay enough to get by.)Is this just needless self-sabotage? Has anyone gone from this point to a new noncreative career? Something outdoors or more hands on seems like it could round out this issue, but it most likely won't offer the "career stability" that a college degree position would supply. I also want to support a family in the future, and would like a job of higher caliber than a dog walker or door dasher.Hopefully this wasn't too long. I appreciate anybody who has made it this far, and I'm grateful for any input. Thank you!

o5cl8q	1624330492	243	I know what you’re thinking - another “I don’t know what to do” thread. Hear me out.I was 24 when I, by PURE chance, landed my then dream job in college athletics as a head coach. spent 3.5 years there and recently got laid off. I kind of have been in a funk really since I got the job in the first place… I think I suffered heavy burnout, but now am working in a physical therapy clinic as a rehab tech. I enjoy it, mostly where I work and the people there, but can’t make a living doing the job. I’ve been thinking of going back to school for either Physical Therapy Assistant or looking into being a X-ray Tech. However, I’ve only ever known the college sports world as work, and I’m terrified of going back to school/spending that money/wasting my time if I end up not liking it. BUT at the same time I get so anxious even thinking about returning to college athletics, I had an interview for a position a couple days ago and can’t stop stressing about what to do. I know I just ranted a lot, but I feel like I need some input. Do I keep trying to love my original passion again as work?Or try something new/scary and get to actually enjoy basketball again as a hobby with the potential consequences of not enjoying my new career path? TIA for any tips on decision making😅

o2f36l	1623985480	732	I just started a salaried position in late May.  I like the job, like my coworkers, generally like my boss, and I think I could be very effective in this role.One aspect is killing me though--my boss has an absolutely psychotic work schedule (like 80+ hours a week and not one day off since I started) and he is pushing me for more and more time each day.  I tried gently making some comments about it at first, and he went from being mild-mannered to obnoxious in a hurry.  I believe he truly just wants to be there all the time and considers prioritizing one's personal obligations to be a character flaw.  I don't believe there is any productive way I can approach him about this.Thing is, I am a very efficient worker and have learned quickly.  I am completely willing to work late to deal with things that can't wait until the next day or special projects.  I am willing to come in very early, but even when I do, he wants me there late anyway and wants me there on "off" days.  He seems very bad at efficiency and prioritizing.  Often when I am there late, I'm not even working--he's just retelling me things he has already said or things that won't matter for months.  It seems that it has nothing to do with how much is actually accomplished--whether I produce 50% or 150% during the day, he just won't let me leave until he feels like it.  I feel guilted every time I finally walk out the door as he stays another 2 or 3 hours.  He has sent me emails at 4 am and 10 pm.  In fact, he made it a point to tell me that he emailed me at 4 am like it was something to brag about and wants me to install the work email on my personal phone.  I asked to replace my desktop with a laptop, but he was hesitant because I think he wants me to have to come in and respond to non-urgent emails.  He has texted me non-urgent items hours after I left work, but seems to have stopped because I never reply.  He has been talking about a monthly phone stipend so I would be required to answer after hours, but I don't want it and don't know if I can refuse.  He insisted that my hourly direct reports install the work email on their phones and check it on their days off, but I told them I would never email them anything I expected them to read on their own time.  I am a front line supervisor who has both opening and closing responsibilities as well as all day work direction responsibilities and nobody to back me up, so I can't even really leave for a few hours or take any days off to make up time.  I have been tracking my hours and I am now making less per hour than my lowest-paid direct report.  (My direct reports are paid hourly.)Again, I love the job and believe I am performing well, but my boss acts as if having a personal life at all is a weakness and it's maddening.  I don't want to leave and I would prefer not to go to HR, but I'm not sure I have any other options.  I also don't want to work as hard now that I'm learning it won't buy me back any of my life anyway.  I have had other hourly and salaried positions, and none of them have been so time demanding.  I feel like I have been reasonable in every way but my boss has the most unhealthy work-life balance I have ever seen and wants to inflict it on me.  He sees it as dedication and a badge of honor, I see it as a road to burnout and problems in the rest of my life.  Instead of spending my days focusing on better ways to do my job, I find myself worrying about how to get out of there.  When I finally get home, I just bitch to my family about my boss's complete inability to understand that a person would want to be anywhere other than work every day.
o0gzri	1623770838	256	I've been working as a healthcare professional for the last few 2 or so years, but through the course of a few difficult placements, and essentially working myself into the ground, I've hit a brick wall.I'm struggling to cope with the 12 hour long days, the difficulty of the shifts themselves and being expected to be in three different places at once, and struggling with the idea that leaving late everyday is somehow now normal. I have given everything and beyond, but I feel work is just killing me at this point.It's physically affecting me, and my energy levels are mostly dire. Annual leave has no effect on me anymore. I'm four days into a week-long stretch of annual leave, and I feel basically the same as when I last left work. But at work, I have a constant mental fog. I function at work, but my performance levels are declining as I'm forced to work harder and longer.  The job is frying me and there's nothing left. I've never felt more disillusioned, fed up and defeated about work and how utterly broken everything is, as I do now, and I just need advice on how best to proceed. I have 6 weeks of my current placement left and I'm dangerously close to using some sick leave to help.I'm also unsure about where this leaves me in terms of a future within healthcare, as my current state has sapped all enthusiasm about my work, and I sometimes struggle to see what kind of future I'll have.
o05n3m	1623731199	90	Hi all:I’m a classroom teacher—I’m passionate about my job but teacher burnout is REAL. I think I’ve reached a point where I’m ready to leave. I am licensed and have my masters degree. I just don’t think I can do it anymore—i am angry at the system and , although I never started teaching for the money (LOL), my pay is ridiculously low despite my experience and advanced degree. I have guilt about this but I want and need financial security. Any former teachers out there who left for another profession?
nzm855	1623675592	203	Throwaway account ... I have worked for a big bank for 9 years as a "financial advisor" in a call center. I have my FINRA 7/66 licenses and have worked in the same sales role for 9 years. My issue is that I feel like I am stuck. I am bored of the sales grind, and have no aspirations to manage a book of business in the future. My role pays well ($100k/yr) with good benefits. I have interviewed for other roles within the company and keep getting passed up for advancement, and have been declined for moving into leadership development program. &amp;#x200B;At what point do I move on? I am a top 25% performer in the role, but feel like I am stuck. Lately I have dreaded the upcoming workday every morning, really feeling the burnout,  and am considering quitting the job with no plan to take a little bit of time off and evaluate my next steps.&amp;#x200B;Does anyone have experience with a similar situation, quitting a high paying job with no back up job lined up? Part of me feels guilty for considering this, most of me feels excited for the mental health break and chance to move into something else.
nz8wz6	1623626720	246	Posting from a throwaway!Up until about 2 years ago, I would have considered myself to be very ambitious. I work in higher ed and had a ladder I wanted to climb in administration. I took on roles that set me up for success and I was on track to go where I wanted to go. However, in those past two years, I've started to enjoy having a life outside of work and, slowly, I feel like my ambition is disappearing. I stepped off of the "ladder" and even thought about leaving the industry entirely. I have a very stable job, that pays well, in a very LCOL area. However, mostly on a whim, I applied to a few jobs outside of my current location that would be a huge step up in terms of role and responsibility and, well, now here we are, and I'm a finalist with a good shot at landing a big job and I...just don't want it?Has anyone ever dealt with something similar? Did you recover your ambition or did you just realize that your priorities had shifted and that having work/life balance was more important to you?The idea of learning a new system and a new job with a lot of new stress just doesn't sound at all appealing. At the same time, I'm worried it is just burnout and a little imposter syndrome that's trying to convince me to stay.I'm 37 now, and 32 year old me would think I'm crazy!
nyzaed	1623599593	543	I'm only a month into my new job, I'm really not trying to judge it this early on, I'm trying hard but I've been feeling I lack the proper needed training, and just feel super lost and all over the place. I sometimes feel like there's a culture fit issue and that I'm maybe not made out for such a type-a work place.I'm currently supposed to give a presentation tomorrow and realize I know nothing about this stuff and cannot for the life of me even put together a 5 minute slideshow explaining something to people more knowledgeable than me. It's one thing that I hate presentation but as I read papers, its like another language. Along with weekly meetings, it kind of is activating my anxiety to constantly have things done.The company is much better than my last one, with a very exciting future, I'd honestly say there's nothing wrong with the company, but more me and how I don't really fit in the culture. I sometimes feel like I'm too laid back for the environment. I really want this to work and I really want to stay here for a while. I like the main work I do, I'm confident in my lab work, but compared to my last job I realize its a much different environment and I feel like a re-rolled toilet paper lol, not as much structure as I was used too.I only have my bachelors, and am probably the only one in the company, everyone else has a PhD. I'm trying to understand the experiments I'm doing, how to better effectively plan for them and analyze the data. I sometimes feel like I spend too much time doing something so simple, then I feel guilty that I'm not doing enough, even though I'm focused on something. We have weekly data meetings, which almost pressures me to have as much prepped, completed, and analyzed as possible.I like my manager, he's a very nice guy, but he doesn't have experience in my specific field, even though he's trying to learn, its hard for me as sometimes as even I'm unsure of things. I sometimes feel like I can't ask him things and have no guidance on somethings. I tried to explain my worries to him, and he basically just said that there's always more to do. And then proceeded to tell me more things I can put on my plate.I know this is on me, part of it is laziness, some of it is lack of training, hell sometimes I just can't even think clearly lol. I know it's good to be uncomfortable and grow, but I sometimes just want to go to work, do what I told and get my paycheck. During my first week, the CEO was saying, If you just want a paycheck then this isn't the place for you. But the company is great otherwise, and really wants its employees to be happy and succeed.Part of me wants to work really hard and succeed, but with learning so many new things, it gets so draining and I know I'll have a worse time coming back from a burnout.How can I either better train myself, or at what point do I start to look at other options?
nwk409	1623320328	199	So I’ve been in restaurants for almost 2 decades, with over 10 years bartending.  I’m a pretty introverted/laid back guy so it’s actually a job that’s extremely out of my comfort zone, but yet, I’m good at it and pretty decent at “faking it til I make it” with the social aspect of it.  I’ve stuck with it for two main reasons: 1. The money(~$25 an hour.  I have no degree so, that’s pretty solid) 2. The flexible schedule/hours/amount of days(I can work 3-4 nights a week and be ok.) However I’m extremely burnt out…of a job that I’ve never really enjoyed in the first place…and the whole last year of covid I was actually working 45hours a week bartending the whole time(people really needed their booze, I guess). That only helped to increase my burnout.  Typical jobs that people in the industry leave for are other types of sales jobs: car sales, realtor, etc. But I’d like to find something less dealing with the public every day.  I’ve literally only worked in restaurants my whole life.Any ideas of something for a laid back yet hard working introvert with no degree or non restaurant experience?
nvwtly	1623247729	102	I’m a 28M with a masters and work in public health, with a relatively niche specialty. I left a job with basically one of the two agencies in my locale after 10 mos, for a *seemingly* better position at the other agency. Turned out to be a huge mistake, I have been here 8 mos and have hated every minute of the job so far. I’m worried I won’t be able to find a position I like without pivoting to private sector and losing a lot of perks (state pensions, etc). I feel completely lost and the burnout is very real. Any advice?
nvtdym	1623237669	406	Hi All,At a bit of a crossroads here. You can see from my post history that I took on a new sales role earlier this year that has just been too much for me to handle. I’m finding it difficult to stay motivated to work and go above and beyond, and I fear that it’ll only be a matter of time before my lethargy will catch up to me and get me fired. I hate myself for it because I’ve always been the kind of person that gives 120%, but for some reason I just haven’t been able to stay motivated and have fallen into some sort of depression/anxiety-driven state that stops me from doing anything. That is a bit of a digression, but it leads me to my next point. I’ve always been intrigued in pursuing a career in a skilled trade. The last few weekends I’ve been working with a contractor for a few hours helping with different tasks, and I love the work so much more. Working with my hands and breaking my body feels so much more rewarding to me, and the person I work with is a great mentor and wants me to learn. While he’s not in the realm of a trade I’d like to pursue (we are doing more carpentry, but I would like to do electric work or plumbing), working with him feels like I am getting my feet wet in the trades and should hold me over until I get a union job down the road.That being said, I feel like a job like that is something I need in my life right now. I haven’t been able to sleep because of the constant stress from my sales job, and every day I think more and more about quitting and doing construction. Only issue is that I would be making less than half of what I make now, with no benefits. I’m currently supporting my mother with property taxes, bills, and mortgage, so making this transition would definitely eat at my savings account at least for a year. There’s friction in that I hate my current job but it’s able to pay me well to support my family.What’s the better move here? Do I sacrifice money to try out a new career? Or do I just suck it up? I just don’t want to go crazy and end up in a mental hospital from the stress and burnout
nvbn8p	1623179035	351	So, my university is very well known for their education program. Where I live, I’m guaranteed a job because of their education program and their reputation. However, I’m unsure about what I will do or if I will enjoy a career in education.I just turned 21 a while ago, and I declared my major in Education (Secondary Education with English Emphasis) during a global pandemic. Starting out, I thought this would be good. But if I’m honest, I’m not a people person, I know teachers aren’t paid what they deserve and I’ve heard tales of personal boundaries being broken due to obligation or via teacher union saying “We need you to stay til’ 5”. The career has a high turnover rate, and I understand why. Thing is, I want to do good in the world. I want to teach and inspire students, but at the same time, I’m not particularly passionate about it. My original plan was to go into STEM, but I got behind in my courses, and I would have to take several years of only math and science course to simply finish the prerequisites. I’d be in tons of debt, where I have financial aid now and I’ll only have less than 10K as a Junior. I often find myself thinking that I can change the education system, but at the same time, reflect on others who have had the same thoughts and ideas, but got burnout or was unable to change anything.I just want some thoughts, maybe some ideas for other paths I can take with this degree so I have options? I do love reading and writing when things interest me, but at the same time, I don’t want to be the teacher students hate because of burnout or depression or simply hating the job. I have two years left starting this fall. I need advice, and honestly? I need to figure this out because I find myself thinking in and out about this decision to the point that it stresses me out and I have anxiety attacks. I need advice, any advice, observations, insight, is welcome.
nv9zgu	1623174551	212	I accepted a middle management position right before the pandemic to manage programs that I have little familiarity with.  Between numerous emergencies, being a new manager, and little programmatic experience, I am fully burned out.  The position is causing me physical and emotional damage.  I recently expressed to my manager that I am struggling and do not see this position being sustainable for me long-term.  Yesterday, the executive director reached out to me yesterday to offer me a lateral position.  She indicated it would require less hours, be performing work that I am passionate about, and be the same rate of pay.  My concern though is that the position describe will be similar to my current position that led to burnout.  I also am worried the work environment is toxic both in my current role and this new option.  But, I do not think I can stay in my current position much longer.  I have applied for other positions, but nothing that is a sure bet.  So, I am really trying to decide between taking this lateral option or quitting and hoping it all works out.  I'd appreciate advice or guidance on how to assess these options to make the best decision.
nty46t	1623020629	93	Hi all, Looking for some advice from the Reddit community. As is the case with many, I’ve been dealing with burnout / feelings of languishing over the past months. And, along with others, I’ve been working more. I’m doing well at work - based on my performance reviews I’m probably going to get a good bonus which I’m grateful for. I’ve been put on back to back to back very difficult projects and it’s starting to wear me down. How do I tell my employer that I’m just tired and need a lighter project?
nrt3rs	1622769244	235	Long story short, I've been working long hours since I graduated college , and have started to feel the dreaded burnout. How many of you have been gotten burnout and what where the circumstances/ did it last? Was it worth it?After graduating college I went straight into the professional world working a corporate job. Immediately I found myself working about 10 hour days (7am-5pm give or take) 5 days a week and this went on for about a year. It was long but I was being paid decently ($85-90K a year range) so I didn't think about it. Eventually those 10 hour days became 12-14 hour days and now here I am years later and nothings changed (except for my pay). Working 12-14 hours a day, 5 days a week for years on end has finally caught up to me and sometimes I cant even do simple tasks like laundry or dishes let alone exercise and normal weekday activities.  I don't hate my job, mainly because I make far more money than I had ever thought I would (I pretty much partied my way through college and didn't go to much class - I know it doesn't sound good). I feel lucky to be where I am but after some thought, I really have put the hours in. What are your experiences with work burnout? Am I being a bitch or is this common nowadays?
nrod9i	1622755356	238	(20)m I just have complete burnout and my shift starts in 2 hours…Yes i know others have it worse than me but i cant just gain motivation because of that reason. Ive been working full time 8 hour shifts since i was 14 and during quarantine ive been getting paid the most ive ever been on unemployment, just sitting at the house playing xbox with my friends.  Now im lazy asf and cant find any energy to do a jobBut i got fired from my other job but thats a different story. Today is my first day at amazon and its a TWELVE HOUR shift. 6pm to 6:30 am. And i think i might be fired because i have no energy.  Ive applied to tons of jobs but literally nobody call back. Then i tried door dash but ofc my parents say its not a real job and to me that sounds like since im not kissing a supervisor ass or reporting to anybody then its pointless to them. Even though i would be making more money doing that than most jobs out here for my age. Idk the point of this post but i just cant do this anymore.  Can you tell me what you would do in this situation? Yes i know im lazy but i can work a regular job just not 12.5 hours a day and no other places are calling back

nre38t	1622728521	328	Yesterday I interviewed for and was subsequently offered a position with a mental health provider. The title would be Associate Director of Psychiatric Rehabiliation and they are offering starting pay of $20/hr with a $1/hr bump on completion of an industry standard certification (CPRP). This is a significant bump in title for me if I accept, as I have been a case manager previously (and adjacent currently) and this role supervises case managers.First off, I'm going to ask them to increase yo $22/hr to keep more in line with my case manager income ($23.85/hr), despite COL difference between locations of Cali vs. central PA. I've not lived in PA before, just moving in 4 weeks, so not sure if that's unreasonable, but given the title I thought it'd be fair. Worst they can do is negotiate down or stay firm.But on to the main reason for my post... On Monday I will interview for a position as Housing Supervisor for the city government and I'm thinking I'd prefer that role. It's not mental health related so less probe to burnout, it's a stable government job, pay scale is the same, and there's no commute (other position is 30mi one way). Detriments are government job so likely regular or random drug testing (I use medical marijuana), job likely entails evicting people, and more bureaucracy because government.I will give an answer to Job A on Tuesday after getting benefits package and negotiation. Is it a very bad idea to accept that position then if Job B offers the position to accept the other and renege on the former? I understand it would burn that first position's bridge, but I don't have an understanding of just how big of a deal that is. Especially if the employers don't overlap in any way. Should I perish the thought or move forward as planned? That's all assuming Job B makes an offer, of course, so perhaps I'm giving my interview skills too much credit.
nrad0z	1622716773	323	I don’t know how to put this, but I’m already sick of what I do for a living and I’m barely a year out of grad school. I’ve been working 7 days on/ 7 days off just recently, but was working a lot more hours before this about a month ago. Been doing this job since last fall and I’ve experienced persistent stress and anxiety each day, even on my last few days off before my work week. I know there are people out there who probably have it worse, but I feel like I’m drowning here. I drag myself to work each day I’m on and I dread the next. Since I work 12-13 hour days and my shift ends around 6am, I’m so mentally and physically fatigued to the point where I barely eat much, have mood swings, can’t sleep uninterrupted, and even want to take drugs just to sleep or get rid of this feeling. But I don’t because I work with patients and it would impair my judgement. I hate that my mood affects those around me. I used to be a bodybuilder and loved working out every single day until covid hit and I took this job. Now I barely have any time for that because of my schedule. I wish I didn’t feel this way, but I know I need to find another job. On my days off, I’m simply happy that I’m off and want to enjoy every single minute of it but I know I should be working on my resume and applying. Only thing is I still have to “work” on my days off (reading up on stuff, etc). I can’t quit my job right now because of personal reasons, but I’m ready to leave this place. Is there anyone with any advice on how to cope with these emotions or maybe even a career path I could consider outside of healthcare? Thanks for reading.
nr7p9k	1622705840	132	I got my MD and have not done a residency. I'm applying for one but also curious what my options for a backup are. To be honest, I fell out of passion with medicine during med school and am doing this because it's the safe thing to do. \-MD (lackluster GPA and scores due to said burnout)\-Intermediate/low advanced competency in Portuguese and Spanish (am a Spanish interpreter). \-Can program (R and Python)\-Have been published (no first author yet)Ideal career\-I would love to travel \-Ideally government related (loan forgiveness + benefits to offset the salary hit)\-Opportunities for advancement\-Work-life balance is a priority and non-malignant reputation.\-I would like something in the field of public health or epidemiology but many require an MPH/DrPH or a residency.\-Advisory role (my strong analytical nature would come into play). Thanks!
nr4kjo	1622693563	139	So, long story short I was watching a Tik Tok video this evening about a guy who owns his bussiness. Somebody commented that he had equipment worth more than his house. He admitted this because his house doesn't make him money. Also stated that he was only in his home, at best, 8 hours a day. Which got me thinking about my personal predicament, I am leaving a job because I barely have time at home to spend with my fiancé. How does a person run there own bussiness and manage to work with life when they're working 14 to 16 hours a day? Is this even remotely possible without suffering from burnout? Or can it be that this guy is a rare breed and us capable of doing something I am not? Not getting burned out on a job.

nmc69l	1622135231	741	Okay, so I'm unsure if this is the right place to post this but I had a bit of a mental breakdown, which was due to personal issues at home and probably alot of burnout from my job. This job ( I live in Ontario ) I had been "forced" to stay on and work over both stay at home orders and throughout the pandemic entirely while others were laid off, I had asked to be laid off as I felt I was working harder for longer doing the same position as others and was even denied vacation over people who had returned after being off for 6 months. This job. Is stressful and physical. They have inconsistent hours sometimes more sometimes less. But the paychecks always seem to end up around the same. I could sit here and complain about ever crappy aspect but it's besides my point. I had been given medication, and 2 weeks off at first to deal with the side effects, which were actually enough not to be able to work. I had extended my time off, due to the impairment by another 2 weeks with the return date of today. I was texted not called, yesterday at 7am asking if I had any restrictions and if I would be returning to work tomorrow. Of course having taken sleeping pills and not having any plans yesterday I didn't wake up until after my boss had already left. I responded hoping someone would still be in the office and tell me she wasn't there or anything. But I didn't get another response until this morning. Again at 7 am, assuming I wasn't working, asleep missed the text asking me to respond by noon if I was going to be in Friday (tomorrow) bec she'd already figured out the day, then another text at 715 asking me to come in and work on a different a schedule. Now going back to a week ago when I handed in my last doctors note for time off (ending today) I mentioned I would most likely be returning to work on modified duties/hours.Here is the response I received : " Thanks for sending the new note. I'm not sure if we will be able to work around modified hours as that will affect both the company' and your partner's income. I guess we will see how you're doing next week before worrying about that. "My partner was also told that it would be impossible and they were waiting to hear from me about which day I'd be returning. And also some attitude was used while saying this. Which is common I have heard/seen it before on the basis of my boss having to re arrange schedules, and our short staff problem that's been a problem since before the first pandemic outbreak. I responded this afternoon via text saying basically I am waiting to hear from My doctor about easing my return, that I needed to consider my mental/physical health over this job as my well being is most important to me, I said I understand some stressors are unavoidable and the way the company works towards financials is based on how many jobs we can perform in a day and how well we can do them. I said my performance will be less than 100% but I can only try my best as physicaly I am less than before and mentally I cannot perform under stress well, I am working towards better management with my health care professionals and my main concern is returning to work safely right now. I had heard about a 10 hour shift tomorrow in which by the sounds of it I would be expected to perform 100% with no restrictions or modified duties. I'm unsure bec I have been reading about Ontario's laws, where they mention something called undue hardship. Which is bases on the financial impact on the company and safety of other employees.I am going to contact EI, bec if I go back on Monday and find it too difficult to return fully and the stress starts up immediately i want to know I have options upon quitting. It's all seemly beginning to stress me out before I am even back, which is probably the number one red flag.If anyone is familiar with ontario/Canadian return to work or stress leave employment laws and has any advice.. Please feel free to comment or pm me. Thanks.
nkczsi	1621903708	137	So info about me:- Working in Cyber Security, about 6 years in the field- B.S. degree- making $130k/yrFeeling really burned out on my field. I feel like I’m not getting interesting problems anymore, and recently changing companies didn’t solve the issue. Different companies, same problems - and pretty much every company has the same cyber security issues. I feel like if I stay I will be working on the same things over and over and perpetually bored.However, the field pays very well and I have a family to support. I can’t really afford to take too substantial of a pay cut - I could probably go as low as $110k or really squeeze into $100k.However, this makes me feel like a career change is impossible because I can’t afford to go back to an entry level salary.Any advice?
nk42w4	1621879268	221	Hello,I've been thinking about my career, especially over the last couple months of the pandemic , where I felt more burnout. That got me thinking about whether I should take a couple months off and do a course / certificate to learn something new while taking a pseudo-break. For context, if I did a short course, the cost would be covered by my org. I wanted to get some thoughts from my fellow Redditors... here is some more info.**Some Background**:* \~10 years into my career* Director, Corporate Strategy at a large organization* Bachelor's in Commerce, along with the CFA designation**Interest*** I'm primarily interested in supplementing my strategy experience with more of a technical base (from a pure interest standpoint, and also, generally, where jobs are headed).

njvq9i	1621855608	453	 Hi! Just a little background, I'm currently working as a freelance comic colorist and variant artist for some small studio based in LA, but I'm from Asia (third world). The job pays quite well, ranging from 125 to 200 USD PER PAGE. This is a lot if added into multiples but since it's a company, the payout is really slow; pages have to be approved and reapproved, revisions make it even slower, and to add to that, in this global pandemic it's really anxiety-inducing to not have a constant stream of cash coming every month. I barely make rent. But this is ( what I thought) I wanted to do, since I'm good at it, according to feedbacks.Before this, I worked as an all-around web designer, UI designer, and WordPress dev for a small outsourcing company for 6 years. The pay was really good, but it had to end due to the pandemic. The company's clients had to close down. --Another reason was I was getting hella burned out because I felt like I wasn't growing. There weren't a lot of mentorship/skill improvement programs inside the company. Growth was stale for 6 years.Right now I'm really weighing my options. Do I want to push through with the art career, something I've been wanting to do for so long and has now found the opportunity to do so, albeit just starting, or go back to corporate design, which could give me a stable income but could potentially be another source of burnout? I like the money sure, but I wouldn't really trade it with my already ailing mental health.Another concern of mine is, I didn't finish my Bachelor's. I only have an associate degree in software development, which probably earned me the first long-term job I had, I consider myself very lucky because, in my country, It's not easy to find a job if you don't have a bachelor's. Now If I do decide to go back to corporate and go jobhunting, my chances would be slim because of my educational background; (this has been pointed out to me during my job hunt when the pandemic began and I lost my job.)I also feel like I need to be in an office and collaborative environment ( hopefully after the pandemic has settled down ) to improve my skills, and hopefully, when I save enough I aim to go back to school. But right now that isn't possible.I'm at a stalemate.tldr; I'm a freelance artist which pays peanuts but I'm also pretty decent and have 6 years of experience in corporate design (UI UX) but finding a job seems hard without a bachelor's and the corporate world could be dangerous to my bad mental health.
njkzs1	1621815123	167	I am currently looking to go back to my field. I left my corporate career in my mid twenties due to burnout ( I am 33 right now). Enjoyed some success as a freelancer and as an artist right after, and waitressing funded a lot of that. I am one of the original servers and have been with the same restaurant for 4.5 years and the same hospitality group for almost 8 ( worked at their nightclub as well). When Covid happened I had the option to become the assistant general manager and I’ve been at the role for almost a year. I have been approached by someone in my field and I am wanting to submit my application but I am unsure on how the restaurant will look in my resume. I have had a lot of high responsibility roles and this one is no exception, I’m sure there are a lot of highly valuable skills that are transferable. Any ideas or thoughts on this ?Thank you
njgj01	1621801994	73	Going on my 7th year as a Social Worker in Child Welfare after getting degrees in Poli Sci and Global Studies in Arizona. Emotionally burnt out and even in a management position I’m capped out at $65k and want to hit six figures somehow in the next 5 years. Any suggestions for career paths? No tech background but am pretty quick to learn and willing to put in time if the opportunities are there.

nivx9e	1621729429	124	Currently head of an org in my company and it’s not the path I want to go down. I love a lot about the company itself, but finding that much of this role just isn’t right for me. Even with some things taken off my plate it’s the foundational aspects of the role I don’t enjoy, like strategy planning, plugging in everywhere to advocate for my team. I’m really just interested in an IC role. Which, would ultimately be a demotion and I’m good with that. There’s really only one role I’m interested in currently there and I’m a little under-qualified with some of the specific skills, just have had no energy to invest in learning with burnout. Any advice on framing the ask well?
niskcq	1621718893	254	23 years old, graduated with a psychology degree. I accumulated a significant amount of research experience in undergrad (I worked in 2 psych labs, volunteered at 1 hospital, did an honors thesis at another hospital), and now I have worked part time as a lab manager for 2 years.I originally wanted to go to grad school for clinical psychology - was rejected. I'm considering a Masters of Social Work down the line, but I hear a lot of stories of burnout and poor career options.Job Option A: Clinical Research Assistant for a psych lab at a well known, prestigious teaching hospital. Pay scale is 40 - 50k, one year contract. This would help if I go to grad school. I have done one interview, have a second scheduled for next week, and they would likely want me to take an offer very quickly.Job Option B: 911 Police Dispatcher, 1 year temporary position, pay is 80k a year. This position doesn't offer a lot of transferable skills, or any improvements to my application if I choose to apply to grad school. If I receive an offer, I wouldn't be starting this position until September (police take a long time to do screenings and background checks).In the short term, the second position seems a lot better, but the first position would help me build my CV more. I also don't know if I have an offer from Job Option B, whereas my chances are quite high for the first one. What would you do in my position?
nhzouj	1621622523	62	 I'm considering working as a social worker to help the homeless, or the poor in general (yes, I know that can take many forms). Social work is notorious for burnout, low pay, and long hours, but I have read a few posts about people who work the usual 40 hours a week. Does that sort of job even exist in this field?
ng6yn6	1621433628	534	I work for a major financial institution and am feeling incredibly burnt out. I’m usually a very driven and curious person who is super passionate about my work but recently I’ve felt exhausted and almost resentful of how much I’m overworking (min 10 hours a day, max 19 hours a day, avg. around 14 hours a day).I WFH in a corporate role and have a great manager. He is super supportive and invested in my career development. I know that if I were to tell him how I was feeling, he’d tell me to log off at 5pm. However, it’s just us two on a massive portfolio and he often sends me emails at 3am because we have so much to do. It seems like the work never ends and I’m constantly trying to finish things that should’ve been done yesterday. I keep mentioning that we need more support but the company won’t approve additional help. I also do not have kids while he is married with 2 kids under the age of 3 so I know that if I work less, it means more work for him (and less time he has with his family). We both work through our lunch and eat our first meal of the day at like 8/9pm everyday. It is also worth mentioning that he literally caught covid but did not take a single day off to avoid overwhelming me. Due to this, I don’t want to ask for less work because my manager is truly the greatest leader I’ve ever worked for. I would never want to make additional work for someone who is so supportive of my career development and personal growth.My daily routine is to wake up, work, eat a meal late at night and maybe scroll through social media briefly before I pass out. I rarely exercise anymore because I feel too tired to move most days. I feel like my productivity has dropped and my mind blanks often. I’ve become almost anti-social and lost my normal cheerful, happy and curious personality. I am still early in my career and know you need to “grind” in your 20s but my previous roles in the organization were a very normal 9-5. I just feel really lost. I still love my job, recognize that I have such a great leader and don’t mind working more than my paid 40hr/week, but my body feels like lead and my mind feels like it’s always on autopilot. All my overtime is also unpaid which I don’t usually mind but it does frustrate me when I’m working a 16hr + day. I am not in investment banking or asset management where these hours are expected. I get compensated far below market value even for a normal 40hr day and cannot ask for additional compensation (only way to get more $ is to apply for a promotion). I don’t know what I can do to recover from burnout without negatively affecting my portfolio and manager. I would be so grateful for any advice. Note: not sure if relevant but all my performance ratings are amazing. Everyone seems happy with the quality of work I deliver and is unaware I feel like this.

n9zqnh	1620747172	319	Hey all. Long story short, I quit my well paying manufacturing job with absolutely nothing lined up (dumb, I know). Part of it was due to burnout but a larger part was due to the constant and ever increasing job stress. Now I’m a bit lost on where to go from here. I have at least 3.5 years of quality experience, starting as a technician in the food and plastics manufacturing industries and quickly rising up to take on more supervisory/managerial type roles. As a supervisor I have had 2 years of experience working as a laboratory coordinator for an ISO accredited lab. This was before transitioning to my most recent role - quality supervisor for a food manufacturing GMP company. Here I only stayed for 5 months prior to my departure. I just want to know what else I could do with my skills above. I’m not sure manufacturing is for me, based on my couple experiences within those industries. I have had some experience with MSDS authoring and honestly believe I enjoy the more technical SOP/document review aspects of the jobs I’ve worked. Essentially I have a good amount of experience (I would like to believe) in a lot of different but related areas and would like to go on a different career path. I’ve looked into clinical applications, documentation review, regulatory affairs, data science but it seems like I don’t have enough experience to even get my foot in the door. Right now I’m looking at any wfh/remote data entry job just so I have something to keep me afloat until I can find a more long-term role. Coupled with this, I’m trying to use my newfound free time to learn python - particularly R - since a lot of interesting jobs seem to require that knowledge to even be considered. So Reddit, what should I do?Please let me know if I should provide any more information.
n9wj4e	1620738216	189	Turned in my resignation 3 months ago (we have three months' notice) due to my burnout, pressure, etc.Without revealing too much, some fundamental changes have been made since then and I've also adapted better to the job, so not as much burnout and pressure. I also love my coworkers and all, and they (plus management) have recently been asking me if I would reconsider.To be honest, I am. But I also don't want them to think I'm too unreliable and don't know how to stick to things. Other people in the industry as well already know I'm leaving (word spreads fast, small industry), so I wonder what they'd think of me or people like me in general.Additional info: I planned to be unemployed until I found a job I like, maybe study programming in the meantime and part-time in my family's company. I have savings enough for at the very least a year, not including support from parents, so I'm not worried about if the company just wants to keep me longer while they search for someone new. Just really worried if there's a reputational aspect I'm not seeing here.
n9t04s	1620725146	141	Hi all, looking for some advice on my current situation.I work in FP&amp;A for Consumer Goods companies, &amp; recently left a global brand to join an exciting e-commerce start-up. However, this job is not what I was hired for &amp; am now looking to leave after just 2 weeks. I've been working until midnight most nights, and there have been a number of resignations before my arrival meaning I'm the only person in the team.Would it be crazy to leave without another job lined up? Classic advice is that its easier to find a job when you have a job, which leaves me worried about my employability.Additionally, would it reflect badly if I took a month off? I feel like I've not stopped working since the pandemic began, and would love a some time off to recover from this burnout.Thanks in advance!
n9hv05	1620685421	294	Late 20's F, got my bachelors in Communications and a graduate diploma in Marketing and went on to work in Marketing for \~7 years. I was always a bit of a swiss-army knife, doing everything from operations (I was almost always employed at a small business) to digital marketing and website development and graphic design. After a string of horrible employers that have either blindsided me or abused me (and I don't throw around that word lightly), my last straw was an employer who was so cavalier about their covid safety that I was having daily panic attacks and my work quality suffered greatly. I resigned and now just trying to have some time healing and figure out what's next.I went into marketing/communications without a lot of thought, like all of my peers I was graduating high school and uni was just the next step. I had to make a choice and I was always good at communications stuff. 10 years later and I'm discovering that I'm an introvert and I don't know if I can live this life anymore. I know that my disinterest in this field is so palpable especially at job interviews - more than once, I've struggled to answer when employers asked me what I like about being in marketing. I just want a job where my success isn't reliant mainly on my ability to suck up, in a high-demand field so I won't have to go through humiliating interview processes like I'd experienced in marketing. I keep thinking about pivoting to something in healthcare but I am very much afraid of regret. What if I make the wrong choice, again? How do I know if I just need a break or if I'm justified in feeling like I should pivot?
n9ckel	1620671977	457	Hello everyone, I was off on mental health leave for 4 weeks with clinically diagnosed depression and anxiety due to work stress. I return this week and though the time off really helped me, I am getting really anxious again about going back to work. I am an engineer working for a well known tech company. I am not a slacker by any means, my performance reviews have always been good and have received a few awards. I have been there for over 4 years and the work hours and environment have never been the best but only recently caught up to me. 60-80 hours a week with no overtime pay or time in lieu. Most weekends are spent working. The people I work with are really toxic. So other than the workload, I am dreading having to interact with these people again. Not going into specifics but I’ve also experienced some sexism and discrimination here. My manager knows I had to take time off due to work stress and mentioned he wants to have a conversation when I return. I am not looking forward to this either. Also just FYI, he's always known how bad my work hours and load are. Also, throughout my mental health leave, my manager who knows why I am off, has demonstrated a lack of boundaries. He originally suggested to me to work 3 hours a week during my time off. When I declined he suggested me to keep my work email and work IM on my phone to be available if someone needs me. When I declined that, he would constantly text me or call me atleast 1-2 times a week to ask when I am coming back. I’ve been truly appalled by this lack of boundaries especially when he knows he is the reason why I am sick. But I guess I shouldn’t be surprised given that back on regular work days he would ping me as late as 10 pm. I am looking for other roles and have no idea when I’ll land one. But for now, I need to return to this environment. Just wondering if anyone has been in a similar position and how they navigated it. Did you have a conversation with your boss on return? Did your other coworkers ask why you were off? How did the first day back go? Were you anxious? Etc. Quitting is an option but I really don’t want to . I am ok financially, I have some savings and my husband makes enough for the two of us. I just don’t want to deal with comments from friends and family asking me what I am up to especially if it takes me a long time to find another job.
n8t6zb	1620612306	367	I grew up in a family of musicians, so they were really supportive of me choosing an artistic career in animation. I worked hard to move to Canada to study, saved up tons, and I'm really grateful that I got out of my first round of education with no debt. At the time, I was *very* certain of what I wanted to do, and was often praised for my confidence, for knowing myself, and for the passion I applied to my initial pursuit. I was good, I became fairly skilled and was always at the top of the class. I might not have been at industry level, but I was growing fast. For a multitude of reasons, I've decided that this career path is decidedly not for me anymore. I burned out terribly, and never quite recovered (likely due to autistic burnout, as well, since I was diagnosed with level one autism very late in life). It's not so much the craft, but many aspects of how the industry works, including things like a tendency towards unpaid overtime, salaries not rising with experience, having gigs that only last 1-2 years and constant lack of stability (even many years in), etc.I've considered many other paths, and honestly, I feel like I could possibly become a good therapist if I applied myself to that. That could change too, but this is something I feel aligns well with my path so far. I know it's not a crazy amount of money, but it's definitely an upgrade from retail. The issue is the path there. 6 years of college education. Which, for somebody who started from scratch financially 6 months ago, is a definite guarantee of a LOT of debt. I know Starbucks has a college program where they help partners (which I mention because I might work there again). But goodness, I fear the idea of long term student debt. I don't think it's smart, I don't think it's right for many reasons, but I don't know if I can avoid it.Should I try it this way (going back to Starbucks and using their help, then taking out loans for my Master's)? Are there other approaches or methods available to me?
n87vzx	1620539873	137	I’m so sick of being in a classroom that there’s no recovering from the burnout. I’ve been working on my resume with the idea that I’ll go back into an IT oriented role, but I’m at a loss for what to go after. Here’s a summary of my skills:-ten years working in private schools throughout Asia: Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Vietnam-Four years in senior teacher roles training teachers, managing departments, writing curriculum, and building programs.-one year as a manager at a, now thriving, education startup in Vietnam.-five years working with international school students bound for America. I’m proud I have a bunch of kids at top ten school in the states.Would anyone know of job titles I should go after outside of the education sector? I love business, but I’m not sure if it’s something I can get into.
n7vxo0	1620500242	444	For reference I am 26 years old working in electronics manufacturing Option 1: Stay at current job. I would make around 70k for the year after bonuses/overtime. This is my first job I've ever had and I've been here for 5.5years. I've made some great connections and really fit into the company culture. They have invested in me and I feel a great deal of respect from everybody. Unfortunately I don't see much financial growth moving forward, I would likely get $1-$2/hr raises a year for the rest of my career. I work my ass off and experience burnout pretty often, but I'm the type of person who uses work as escapism sometimes so maybe it's a good thing? My commute is 10-15min and painless. My life has been built around the location and lifestyle of this job.Option 2: Remote Job offer. Annual salary of 80k BEFORE bonuses, no overtime. This is a pretty big jump in salary for me, probably the equivalent of a $10/hr raise. Job title is a big upgrade and the company has a lot more growth potential. Through the interview process it felt like THEY were selling the job to me. They are promising to me a much more "relaxed and chill" work environment where I just get my work done independently and that's it. Cons are that it is completely remote and I would very rarely ever see anybody that I work with. I see this as a pretty big risk with the most up-side. I have no idea what to expect in terms of working from home. Option 3: Current Jobs Competitor. I've received an offer from my current companies local competitor. $5/hr raise from current job would probably put me around 80-85k after bonuses/overtime. There is room for growth in the company more than my current. I've heard a lot about the work culture not being great. I would likely experience the same burnout that I do at my current job but without the personal connections. It also comes with a longer commute 30-40min. There's also the guilt of switching to a direct competitor.I am leaning towards option 2 but it makes me a little skeptical how much they were trying to sell me on the job. Maybe I am worrying about this too much, maybe they are being genuine.I feel like staying with my company is the safe and easy option. I would happily continue working there and I would really miss the people and connections I've made.Any input from the outside is appreciated! I am half doing this for myself to write down my thoughts and have it all laid out in front of me.Cheers
n714hb	1620401232	234	Hey guys! so let me quickly tell you what i am going through, i have been doing web and app development since the last 2 years and it is becoming very boring for me now.I am 20 years old and in my 3rd year of Engineering \[it is a 4 year course\] in a not so reputed college in Mumbai, India where (education == completing assignments)?"true":"tbh its only true"..I just want to be done with this college and then i plan to move to US and pursue my Masters..But currently I am in a serious burnout phase where i do not know what field of computers is best for me!?? It is really frustrating to think about not coding since 2 weeks.There isnt much coding culture in my college but when we take IIT\[top colleges in India\] into consideration, the students there are woven into that culture which is so damn good!!And i am in my 3rd year now which i think is a late realization on my end where i found out i do not enjoy web/ app development..I am really confused what else to do, I have some interest in embedding computers into human body to solve human diseases/ disabilities, however evil it may sound, i do not know what field it is though?Any guidance?&amp;#x200B;TL;DR20 year old cs student bored of web/ app development and wants to know what else he can do
n6tdvs	1620374618	295	My Dad is 55 and works at the local hospital here in Germany as a technician for about 20 years. Recently a guy a few levels up decided to try to cut some costs wants to demote my dad. So he’d basically get less money for the same work. The thing is, most of his collegues are also relatively old and will retire soon, so it’s not like they have an aboundance of staff and he’s being paid 15% less than the same job in most other companys.Now that situation triggered depression and/or burnout in my dad and he is diagnosed sick and unable to work since a few month but still gets called when there are emergencies.He wants to work again but (can) not under these conditions. He wants to (and in my opinion should) work less hours.The problem is his boss one level up is and will not really do anything against his higher ups.My dad is good at his job but not so good at talking.My idea is to track his work and the „emergency“ calls and calculate how much the would cost if they were to be handled by an external company and put all this information in a nice excel sheet/graphs and then send it with an explaination as an email to his boss, the guy who wants to cut cost and his boss with the request to keep his hourly wage and work less hours. If he were to quite my parents would probably be able to handle it financially somehow, but it would be too great. And I’m not sure how easy it is for find a new job at 55 right now.Is that a good idea or do you have any suggestions on how to handle this situation?
n69m72	1620314160	137	Long story short, I work in a giant insurance company as an entry job meeting scheduler.   I've been doing this job for the last 3 years in 3 different companies, each time burning out at approx. 9-12 months in.   I feel it physically creeping up on me again and the only way I can see me handling this is either getting stressed and eventually burning out and calling in sick for 3 months - or switching to a completely different job - however, my only experience on CV, is telemarketing (and I'm damn good at it).  How do I approach this? Do I just suck up the heart palpitations and shortness of breath and keep on going? I cant afford to quit with all my bills. Is there any way to handle this?
n5odmw	1620243056	290	Looking for some perspective.I’m in my mid-twenties and am currently at my third job post-graduation. Each job has been some combination of sales and account management, and I’ve reached a point now where I’m feeling lost.My first job out of school was in a new city and after about 1.5 years, I left for home due to burnout and to escape a toxic work environment. My second job I worked out of my parents house locally for another 1.5 to 2 years, and left toward another city for my Masters and more opportunity. Now in my third job for a little over 1.5 years, and I have been informed that I will be fired soon as my performance is not meeting expectations — that being said, I am in a field that has been stopped dead by COVID, and my department has seen many lay-offs and total turnover is close to 80%. I am burnt-out, stressed, and have no friends at work. Case in point, I think this is ultimately for the better.This all being said, I’m worried about my future. I’ve churned through three jobs in close to 5+ years, as a result of burnout and circumstances often out of my control. Is it me, or am I looking in the wrong places for work? It’s probably a combination of both. And how might I be viewed in the future by those hiring? I feel inadequate and I don’t like it.I am considering changing fields entirely. My hope is to find something new to set my mind to instead of just another sales job. Is that a reasonable consideration or have I just not found the right place to work yet?If you’ve taken the time to read this, thank you.
n4dkq8	1620094130	127	Hello Everyone,I need some advice. I have a Master’s in Global Development and Peace. I have spent most of career working for non profits in various roles (administration, program development, community engagement, AmeriCorps). My original goal was to work in program management within the nonprofit sector but I have realized that working in nonprofits have some serious drawbacks that I can no longer deal with. The problem is I am not sure what to do next. I am not even sure if my problem is with the nonprofit sector (the burnout is real) or that I need to simply switch my focus in terms of job roles. I am just looking for advice to see if anyone else has ever felt this way and how did you pivot?
n415l4	1620061026	314	TLDR: I want time off (1 week in spring, 1 week in fall ...and maybe a day or two throughout the rest of the year for Dr appts, etc.). Is that too much time to want off? I don't get PTO, so it would be my own financial loss (which I would plan for and be willing to take in order to get the much-needed mental break).The long version:For context, I'm technically part time, but my schedule is as close to full time as possible. Based on the fact that I spend five days a week at work, 10am-5pm on average, I feel like I'm full-time with none of the benefits (other than fairly competitive pay). I have no PTO, no sick days, no mat leave ...if I'm not here, I don't get paid. However, I am willing to miss out on some money for the sake of my mental health and enjoyment.While this job is not meant to be a career-long position for me, I see myself being here for at least another year. In the meantime, I still need a heathy work-life balance.My ideal amount of time off would be 2-3 weeks spread through out the year.  Ideally, 1 week in spring, 1 week in fall, and then a day or two here and there as needed. Is that too much to want?I feel like part of the problem is most of my coworkers hardly take any time off because they want the extra money, and while that's fine for them, I don't want to feel obligated to keep up with the same toxic work-life balance. The amount of burnout amongst my coworkers is ridiculous.Ultimately, I know I need to move on at some point, but in the meantime, I want to know... What do you consider an acceptable amount of time off? How much do you personally need to feel recharged?TIA!
n3oscn	1620019922	628	Hello! First here, I'm 18 and graduating high school next month. For reference this is Egypt, but I've studied as part of the British system of IGCSE/ALs, for reference of what I did and what subjects I'm good at and not,Sociology A*, English First Language A*, Bio A, Chem A, ICT B, Art &amp; Design A, Econ B, Maths B/C, AS Econ A. I'm currently repeating Econ since the B was due to a stupid mistake I made in the first exam and I'm doing physics which I have found to be fine so far.I have been trying to figure out what I want to do for the past year to no avail. My original intention since Y9 was to study something art or creative related and head into a career in animation or film, I had decided that without much thought on why I want to except that I just really liked creating things. Eventually, I get extremely burned out and I just stop making things from the severe burnout and I have gotten back bit by bit into things again. Thus, I had decided on architecture thinking its a realistic career, I'm making things that benefit others and I'm still being creative to some degree at least. I had thought I can do architecture as my back up degree and undertake animation courses and utilise my summers to search for opportunities to further training. Even though I know that I would practically have no time for anything else. I have applied and been accepted to a good architecture program with verification by RIBA with them waiting my physics result. However, they give the option to July something if I want to pull out.Then I start reconsidering animation as a degree and other options, especially since here with the New Capital there are many universities popping up offering dual degree programs from abroad, which for me is convenient since I am not a fan of studying away from home for 4 years. Now I am faced with an option for architecture, animation,game design and etc. I know I want to make things, be creative and ya I want to tell stories visually somehow. I want to form a connection with whoever is consuming the story, sharing ideas,ideals and themes. I want to lead, I want manage and etc. IThough with all of that the idea of career safety exists, yes I have been told to do what I like and want, but career safety and satisfaction has to be addressed right? If I enter animation,game design, etc, there is a very good possibility that I enter that industry and I can never reach a rank where I can lead and tell my own story. For example, I enter animation, I go work in a good studio, I can stay my entire career working on someone's else's vision and that just doesn't jive with me. Yes, I fully understand that to reach the position I need to work my way up, gain experience and prove my metal. But, can't someone do all of that and just not reach that?My personality and work ethic is that of go all the way or don't do it. I can take on a large and stressful workload and do it,but if its something I'm not passionate or interested about, I will do the work to the best quality I can but I would hate every second of it and need to recover afterwards. I like to manage and lead projects something I found doing extracurricular things such as Student Council president, Editor of the school magazine and such. I will doing things without skimping on them. Thanks for anyone with advice, and I apologise if any of this came of like a ramble.
n3c7a0	1619979008	124	I’m about to choose a degree in few months but I’m still torn between the threee above. Can I get an insight on what it’s like on these field base on your experiences? I’m planning to take BS IT, BSBA Financial Management, or Medical Laboratory Science.I like them all but not to the extent. I don’t have dream job, but I’ve got a dream lifestyle. I’d love to work in flexible hours and low burnout career. Tech is great I heard and the pay. If I take BSBA Finance, I’m planning to extend it to master’s degree for better opportunities (but they said corporate world is stressful is it truee), MLS is interesting for me but it’s a stagnant job they said. What to doo?
n0sd08	1619654696	253	Hey all. I live in the United States, in central California. About a year ago, I became fascinated with the idea of learning how to program. I started in Javascript, and then about half a year ago I moved on to Python, and then a few months ago I started on HTM. I'm really enjoying the journey and hope to be ready to tackle C++ soon. Recently, someone told me about a programming class I can attend in my area that might help me land a job. (He works in web development around here.) What started out as a silly hobby is starting to seem like something I could do as a full time job, but I'm worried about burnout.Another option is to see if I can advance in the company I'm in now. I do administrative work for a brokerage company, and I've become increasingly interested in how everything runs in real time before I put all the date in a spreadsheet. Although I love my job, I'm thinking of eventually seeing if I can become a representative.Also, my main passion is illustration (I've done my fair share of commission work and am currently working on a webcomic) so whatever I do, I want it to leave enough creative energy to keep making art on the side.Which one of these career choices do you recommend? Also, if you have any other suggestions, I'm all ears. I don't know what direction to take my life in next and would really, really appreciate some guidance!
n0k9rt	1619631464	542	I'm 27 years old and I am Burnt. TF. Out.I've been at my job for 7 years and have accumulated many responsibilities as a member of management. I like my job responsibilities but I often feel under-appreciated. My salary is $50k per year, plus a yearly bonus and, under normal circumstances, I commute 3.5 hours to 4 hours per day which costs me over $5,600 per year. I leave the house at 8am in the morning and return at 8pm in the evening. Due to living in an apartment, I can't do laundry past 9pm so I have to do laundry during the weekends, along with grocery shopping and meal prep. I have no time to go to the gym or see family or friends until the weekend. We started working remotely March 2020 and we are looking to transition back. To get to my office, I need to drive and take a train. I have no life and I am very, very tired all the time. Working remotely has been a massive blessing. I don't necessarily stick to the 9-5 hours (if something isn't time sensitive I might decide to take a 30 minute walk and come back to it and work til later in the evening), but all work is always done on time and, in my opinion, communication hasn't been an issue: I'm always available on email, Slack, text, calls, etc. My boss's are old school and can't wait to have everyone back in the office but I can't begin to describe to you how nauseous I am at the thought.We have busy periods that I'm 100% understanding and willing to be in-office for; but during the rest of the year, I'd really like to work from home at least 2 days a week. I know face time can be important but we are not so collaborative that Zoom or calls don't work - really, it's been fine.The difference in commute costs for me would be over $2,000 per year. I don't get paid enough to keep up with this commute and the cost of living closer to my job doesn't make it easier. I need approximately $15,000 more for it to be worth it (once you factor in commuting costs, commute length and what that is worth, plus the amount of hours I devote outside of the 9-5 requirement). &amp;#x200B;I don't want to leave without trying to have the conversation. I've built out a spreadsheet that shows my commute times, cost, and also am trying to construct an argument that shows how preventing my burnout would be best for the company. We are a small office of only 6-8 people (depending on the time of year), and while everyone is replaceable I really am pretty essential. Hiring someone else would mean 2 years of training. It's in their best interest not to lose me. Do you have any advice on how to make a strong argument for part-time remote work? I know to take my boss's position into consideration and try to make a strong argument for why preventing my burn-out is better for the company, but really anything you can offer is wonderful (or if you've been in a similar position, that would be helpful too). Thank you!
n0glkd	1619621662	530	 First of all, I'm a freshman in college. I'll try to be as concise as possible: worrying about what I should do for a living has tortured me for the past year and a half. It's part of this overarching fear I have of "wasting my life"; waking up one day when I'm 61 years old realizing that I'm unhappy and unsatisfied. That thought petrifies me. All I really want is to be happy.I've given this tons of thought, and here are some conclusions I've made:\- as terribly cliche as it is, it seems my calling is to help people in need.\- The ONLY career I'm interested in is working for the FBI. I've talked to a career counselor, talked to people in different fields, done tons of aptitude test.\- What makes me happy (*actually* happy): friends and family, laughter, basketball. I want to have time for this stuff when I'm older.So, I'm deterred from working for the FBI because it's highly likely that it will severely interfere with those things I listed that make me happy. I'm afraid that it will cause me to resent my career, and that I'll be just another miserable prick who hates getting up in the morning. So, I've done some more thinking. Here are the things I want in a job:\- Solid pay ($70k+/year)\- A job that helps people (preferred, not required) that *isn't* psychology, medical, etc (see below)\- Good work life balance (40-45 hrs a week)With that criteria listed, it seems like I have some options. Sure, there are options. But in terms of what I'm actually interested in? Before I go on, I'll have you know that I've done LOTS of research on these careers. I'm not just assuming I'll dislike something. I could go into lots of detail about why a certain career doesn't interest me, but that would take too long. Just trust that I'm informed. I've talked to a lot of people in these fields. So, social work intrigues me, but it's a field notorious for crappy pay, long hours, and burnout. I'm afraid it will make it extremely difficult for me to be happy. Occupational therapy fits the bill, but I've always said that I'll never do a medical job, because medicine doesn't interest me in the slightest. Just thinking about the job bores me. School psychologist/counselor: the former sounds boring (lots of testing, paperwork), the latter pays nothing. I worry so much about pay mostly because it's likely I'll be divorced one day, and divorce could devastate me financially. I've heard too many adults complain of how miserable they are because of divorce for me not to worry about that. Elementary school teacher? There are lots of cons to that, and I don't think it'd be worth it.I mean, with all of this said, can anyone give me suggestions for what I should do for a living? Keep in mind those three criteria I listed for what I want in a career. Do I have too high of expectations? Am I looking at things as black and white? I'm just trying to make an informed decision. Other people love their jobs. Why the hell can't I?
mz65od	1619466275	380	Hello, if this isn't the place to ask this sort of thing, I'll delete. I graduated from Michigan State University in 2019 with a Bachelor's degree in Psychology and a minor in sociology. I'm planning on going back to med school and finding a lifelong career there or after. I haven't decided whether I'll be a therapist or go all the way and become a psychiatrist, but one of those two is my goal.   I have been working for the last year with a mental health organization as a residential technician at a handfull of group homes for mentally disabled adults. Its basically babysitting but with the risk of having a man twice your size hit you with furniture because they're having a meltdown. I get along pretty well with the residents I work with but the stress is unbelievable. I'll spare you the details but a combination of disability and growing up in an abusive household set up just the right stressors and triggers that this job is very good at pressing. I love working with the guys and seeing them happy and it makes me feel good knowing I'm helping them to live good lives, but I can't take the stress anymore. Its bleeding into my personal life, I'm exhausted even after just a 5 hour shift, my sex drive has plummeted and I'm going through burnout almost monthly. In about a month I'll have the year of experience working with disabled and addicted people that everywhere seems to want. I need to get out of this job before it kills me. I don't want to work with children because that will definitely have similar results, especially when dealing with their abuse. Thank god my current job responded to my application before CPS did!&amp;#x200B;I don't mind working with the disabled, but I don't think I can handle working with them at their house, where they live and no other staff to help me without having panic attacks and being unable to enjoy life.&amp;#x200B;tldr: is there a decent job for psych grads that I could work that isn't a group home or a CPS case worker that I can work in until I finish medical school? Currently making $14 an hour and would like at least that much.
mwhan0	1619132551	310	I am a 27 year old male American tech worker with an engineering degree that has been in the workforce for 6 uninterrupted years since graduation. I have a very strong track record of job commitment, since I have been working for 5 years for the same company, 4 of which were in the same position.Recently, I have been experiencing severe burnout due to COVID and a huge relationship breakup. I am at the point now where I am contemplating quitting my job this summer to travel for a few months. This is something I've always fantasized about, and I want to do it while I am still young and have no family to take care of. I am fortunate to also be in a strong financial position since I am a big saver.The thing that concerns me is looking ahead at getting a job when I get back. I will have a gap of several months in my resume, and I am wondering how I can explain it on my resume and in interviews. In my opinion, the American work culture is toxic in the sense that employers look unfavorably upon taking extended time off to travel. I believe being honest about the traveling would do me a disservice in the hiring process. I am honestly of the mindset that it is none of their business what I do with my time off. As long as I am honest with everything else in my CV, I personally don't see a problem with it since it doesn't impact my profile as an employee.Would it be unethical for me to lie to explain this gap? Maybe I could say something of the effect that I tried to start a business and it failed, tried to teach myself how to code, or that I quit to take care of sick grandparents or something.
mujgzy	1618896361	279	Like many others in this past year, I am feeling lost and burnt out. I've built up decent skills in a current branch of my field (video editing) but its never something I wanted to do long term. However the longer I do it, the more skills I build that are very specific to this job and I'm finding it harder and harder to get out of this part of the field. I was offered a position as an editor with a great company but everything inside me is just screaming no. My current job is fine, good pay and benefits but my issue with both jobs is they just aren't things/topics I'm interested in. It's like my brain is fried and just doesn't know what to do with this job anymore. I realize this is a stupid thing to complain about, having a job and receiving a good job offer but I just find myself dreading work the next day and dragging myself through projects but not wanting to take this other opportunity either. When I think about leaving this part of the field I have no idea what else I could/ would do. I don't want to start from the ground up again. I try to use extra time to learn to skills but even then it's like I just don't know what to do with myself. I don't know what I'd like. So I just stay where I am. How did you find what really interested you in a career?How did you get a second wind after feeling so burnout and lost? How can I justify turning down a good opportunity just because my gut says no?
msmmnm	1618646051	645	I am struggling with serious burnout. I am drowning. I work in mental health as a clinician at an IOP type setting for youth. My job has never been good but my goal has been to stick it out for a year. I reached that goal in March.I am very committed to my clients but my team is not. I have worked every holiday. I don’t get benefits. I couldn’t get a raise. My supervision is a joke. My coworkers smoke pot all day, my boss is never around, we do not have policies reflecting what we are doing in telehealth. The last point is important to me. Since covid we have been forced to use our personal devices to contact clients (Google voice) and if I were to forget to turn on do not disturb and go into my phone settings to shut off notifications I will get texts from kids after hours reporting significant safety concerns (suicide). It got to the point where I was losing sleep and I ended up getting into an argument with my coworkers over this. I have been there the longest and the coworkers that told me to ignore the messages have been there for a handful of months or they are unlicensed bachelor level. It wouldn’t be an argument if there were policies to direct us what to do in a situation like that.I took a week off. Best week I’ve had in a year. When I came back everything went to shit. I made the choice to put in my resignation and work the last 2 weeks from home because I was getting a constant barrage of shit from my coworkers.I have 2 days left. Just 2 days. I can’t do it anymore. Apparently my coworkers were upset with how I ran groups yesterday and I was told they needed to let me know by Monday if I can run a special group for my client that will be graduating the day I leave. They didn’t tell me what I did wrong. I snapped.Told my boss I will finish the last 2 days speaking with my clients individually. Boss said no, that I need to finish the last 2 days and say bye to the kids. I can’t do this, especially if I am unable to do the job because my coworkers were weird about me joining group (kept me in the waiting room for 10-15m and wouldn’t make me cohost.. we use zoom). I terminated with my clients. I have sobbed everyday for the past month. I’m not sleeping. I lost a drastic amount of weight. I feel like my body is falling apart. I’m actually depressed and worried for my well-being.I have done well with my clients. I’ve gotten good feedback from them. I have coworkers kids requesting to speak with me because they feel I “get it” more than they do. I know I’m good at what I do. But at this point I feel as if I’m too unstable to do this. I feel my license is at risk staying there but I also feel my boss could go after me for abandoning my clients. Also they could call the new job I have lined up and tell them not to hire me (apparently they’ve done this).I just want them to let me go. I’m at the point I just might not show up next week. I was determined to leave as graciously as I could and just slip out the back but that’s not happening. I feel like a failure. I am at a loss what to do next. How do I recover from this? Do I just not go back? Do I become spiteful and report the agency?If this isn’t the right place to post this I’m sorry. It’s almost 4am and I’m in a terrible place. I want to disappear.

mrv80d	1618544994	463	TLDR: I feel so stuck! Should I become a teacher or a therapist or some magical third highly paying meaningful thing??Hey! I’ve made some pros and cons lists and talked to family members but am just feeling a bit stuck and would love some help. I currently do customer support for a few nonprofits and make about $40k. In lots of ways, this job has been great as a first salaried “real job”; I help nonprofit orgs! I don’t have to think about it outside of work! I have been able to work remotely during a pandemic! I try to be positive about it and grateful but I am just bummed out of my gourd most days and the idea of working for a corporation longterm makes me want to cry. There’s also no real growth and I don’t have much interest in the customer support field longterm. I’ve realized that I want my daily work to be meaningful and I really like working directly with people. I have gone back and forth trying to decide what to do next. I live in a pretty LCOL area while my husband goes to school and eventually he’ll make a great income, so I feel pretty flexible in the job I can choose (like, outside of paying our bills, I’m okay not making a ton, although obviously I’d prefer it ;) ) I’ve been weighing the pros and cons of two:Elementary school teacher: I could do an alternative teaching program with my existing undergrad degree and become a teacher in the fall. The starting salary would be about $45k. I LOVE kids and my nannying and babysitting jobs are my favorite ones I’ve ever had, plus I’ve had experience teaching and am pretty good at it, but I’m nervous about the potential burnout and daily chaos of managing a classroom, haha. Mental health counselor: it would probably take 4-5 years to become a full fledged counselor and make ~$60k, but from what I can tell I could make about my current salary after I’m done with school and working as an intern/associate. I’m drawn to this because I’m a pretty empathetic person who would love to be able to help people work through their issues and the potential flexibility seems really nice. I’m also nervous about the burnout and long road to become a therapist. Right now, work just feels like a drag and I’ve started feeling more depressed all the time, even when not working. I do think seeing a therapist could help me work through some of these feelings, but does anyone here have advice for what to choose next to enjoy my job more and feel fulfilled? Can you think of any other jobs besides these two that might be a great fit?
mrdjie	1618489421	291	I’m aware this question gets asked a lot but I want some advice / guidance with the circumstances specific to my education I currently have a diploma (associates degree equivalent) in community services and I’m thinking about starting a 3 year bachelors of social work. This is really the only direct path into the field as you need it for registration Beyond that though, at this point in time I have enough experience to apply for work as a support coordinator and earn an average middle class living. I could choose to spend the rest of my time entering the work force and it’s a safe decision imo. The thing is, I have always had a deep intellectual curiosity as well as predisposition that is almost hungry to apply myself in learning. I strongly want to understand this world better and start to actually apply myself in life. I was never a good student in school but this makes me more hungry to test limits which I haven’t really exhausted as much as I could have.  The drawback to studying though is that I would have to juggle casual work, University and placement (unpaid internship). This would affect my current income quite a bit and I’m already paying a car off as well as paying for an $8000 Invisalign treatment. Social work is also a bit of a gamble as there is lots of burnout in the field. I would hopefully move to a macro level job. It would also delay myself saving for a home deposit by a fair amount of years and put me in more debt. I need to get out of my living situation ASAP as it can be very toxic. Any advice is deeply appreciated. Thanks

mrc8ym	1618484293	304	Hi, I desperately need some advice. My company uses the Bell curve for performance management. Just to clarify, I am not from the western world but from an Asian country.Bell curve system of performance appraisal is a forced ranking system imposed on the employees by the management. Through this system, the organization tries to segregate the best, mediocre and worst performers and nurture the best and discard the worst.I recently have been very, very burnout, stressed and depressed. But I can’t quit because that is a pathway to unemployment. I suspect my organization is trying to pigeon-hole me to meet the bell curve. I am very stressed and don’t trust anyone in the workplace. I feel like management is out to pick on me.I was recently asked to focus on the below feedback:“mention about growth/struggle in project implementation working together with others, and how I learnt to manage this project with many stakeholders (trainers, execs). this is a good place to indicate if you feel more support is need for any task, and we can discuss it.”“Do add in if you encounter difficulties ie or other aspect of work , and if you think you have suggestions to overcome them. All thoughts are welcome even if we cannot find a concrete solution right away.”I am afraid of being honest, because the last time I did that, they made it look like I was incompetent and cut my bonus. I desperately need some advice on nice things to write that make me look intelligent, without a sense of sarcasm and “blaming others”. I need to write things that they like to see but I am all out of idea. I am very overwhelmed at work but it was already hinted to me that I shouldn't be complaining as my portfolio is already light (in their view).
mrayvm	1618477671	71	So I recently burned out / mentally couldn't deal with my last job. It was just getting way too stressful and unmanageable my mental health was taking a toll. It's been 2 months now and I just started a new job last week. I barley have motivation to work and I'm still finding it difficult to focus / get motivated. People with similar experiences how long did it take you to recover?

mqvbsd	1618420842	466	I’ve been trying out several different fields of work for quite a while now. I’ve taken every career test in the book and spent extensive periods of time researching different fields trying to find the perfect fit. My biggest problem has always been that my natural strengths and interests tend to be in fields that pay poorly, have poor job security or require extensive schooling. For example I’ve always loved the arts, sociology, anthropology, psychology, and english. I’m definitely more right brained.Financial stability and job security are very important to me so I’ve tried to challenge myself to try fields that are more technical so I can make a decent wage without having to take on an extensive amount of debt and schooling. Trying to do the “smart” thing. I’m currently working as a phlebotomist which was supposed to be a stepping stone for a higher level medical career but I’m starting to think this may not be the right choice for me.I like interacting with patients. I don’t even mind dealing with rude patients. My biggest issue is how technical and precise everything is. I feel like there is no room for creativity and I dislike that it requires a lot of tactile/physical precision. I am much more of a mental+social person than a physical person. I’d rather talk to someone or calm down and irate patient than have to perfect a certain movement, motion or position like I am now or physically help someone do something. I also hate all the troubleshooting with different analyzers and machines in the lab. It’s all very detail oriented. I can be detail oriented when it comes to reading social cues or body language but not when it comes to repetitive numbers and cold hard data. I honestly think being in something like social work or counseling would be a better fit for me and always have. The thing is I’m trying so hard to make myself do something that is more financially viable and won’t require me to move back in with my parents for 6+ years for school + a ton of debt just to make a little bit more than I am now. Everyone I know advises me against doing something like social work: less pay, high stress, high burnout, poor return on investment, no work life balance. I could go to school for about 2 years and make more than a social worker doing a technical degree in the medical field and work 3 days a week but I just hate what I’m doing now and don’t think that will be any better. Should I just suck it up and do the smarter, more efficient thing or go through all the trouble with debt and school to do something I actually like and excel at?
mncv5h	1617957417	439	Context: I’m 19, and I’m a freshman in college. I have had many interests (animation, coding/computer science, art, design, writing, reading, helping others, psychology, language, strategy, forensics)over time. Unfortunately, I’ve been so stuck in thought that I don’t actually do anything about these interests. Every personal setback from health anxiety, depression, stress, fear, and procrastination has led me to a path with no destination or numerous roads with dead ends. I know that art related degrees don’t have a good prospects, and I could burnout in the future. So I figured the art related stuff is better off practiced on my own time. I haven’t looked at coding/computer science at all yet I’m considering it as a major/career. I have looked at data science, but the fields seems to math heavy so I’d burnout quickly. Basically, I’m considering coding out of necessity rather than enjoyment. I’ve always been interested in strategy when I’ve played games or shows with strategy elements. I liked the process of thinking through obstacles. I guess you could I like problem solving. I didn’t like my cashier job, so I know I don’t like customer service. I don’t like math or science, so I doubt I’d like engineering. With forensics, i haven’t looked into it much. I think it could go decent, but with the science involved I’m not sure whether or not I’ll like it. I did chemistry and biology lab classes, and it felt like just a means to an end. With psychology, i can’t get a job in what I want with at least a masters, and there’s not many jobs for those with only a bachelors. Also, If I change my mind down the road, I would’ve already gone too far to change careers. Language majors didn’t seem bad, but with the career I had in mind I thought it could be automated in the future. So I’m considering majors with more versatility in case I get bored with one career. I haven’t given business much thought, and I don’t even know myself enough to know my strengths. All I know is that I have jack of all trades, writing, and consulting from unbiased sources. I’ve tried personality tests but they only made things confusing, so I just say I have an introvert personality. With testing my strengths I can’t help being biased. It seems like the more information I take in, the harder the decision becomes. Would an easier choice be to just accept a career with market value and stop stressing ? If there’s a better option than this, what would it be as far as careers and majors ?
mlobyn	1617750134	179	Two weeks ago I left my workplace after 2 and a half years due to excessive burnout and signs of depression. I decided to be as graceful as possible, I shook everyone’s hand and wished them well. Everyone asked me about my future, I answered them that I hope it’s bright.      Then it started. I started receiving calls and linkedin messages from my Sales Manager and Managing Director. They started off from passive-aggressive to full-on threats. This has been going on for about 10 days now and they haven’t skipped a day. I never responded to them badly, I even tried being polite, apologized without need and thanked them for the mentorship. They started threatening me that they’ll make sure I never find work again and that I’ll be sorry for the rest of my life. I never thought such a thing would happen to me and it makes me feel sick.     I need advice. What can I do? Blocking them would show them they have won, I don’t want that.

mkptp4	1617643178	146	Hello All,I am experiencing burnout after some years with my company and the pre-work dread is almost insurmountable. I find myself slipping as of late so I want to also save my reputation. I feel that I am ready to move on and would like to take time to recalibrate.With this in mind, I am managing the onboarding of a new customer at the moment, and would like to avoid causing issues for my team and senior leaders. I don’t want to hurt the company’s image either. Is two weeks of notice enough? One month? Should I try talking things out with my leaders to see if we can come up with a different solution? Would you even mention your intent to leave at that point? Thank you. I am struggling. I am fatigued and my mood is low. Everything is on fire and I feel trapped.
mgfqey	1617109979	336	I'm an attorney.  I typically work long hours and am expected to be available to clients from about 8:30 a.m. to about 6-8 p.m. M-F.  I also work on weekends on administrative matters.  I last took a vacation in August 2020 and I worked 5-6 hours a day for the entire week of vacation.  My last vacation before that was in December 2018.  I worked on that vacation too.  I am burnt out and feel a growing sense of dread about work each day.  When a client sends me a complicated question or legal issue that needs answering, I instantly feel overwhelmed and stressed out about giving the wrong answer.  It has become almost debilitating recently.  Some of this seems unique to me, because about 1/2 our team never seems this stressed about things.  However, the more experienced folks seem very stressed and one of my colleagues just left because the stress was too much for her.  I then inherited a part of her case load.    I am still sleeping okay at night and still taking care of my health.  But I constantly feel like I am on the edge of disaster.  I told my wife the other day that I feel like I am in a game of Tetris where the blocks are falling so fast that I cannot figure out where to put them anymore.  I feel like I am just stacking them anywhere they will fit and waiting for the inevitable end of the game.   I am in okay financial shape (out of debt, except for my house) but I spent a lot of years paying off debt and don't have a lot of financial cushion (six months of savings before I touch retirement funds).  I also need the six-figure income in order to save for retirement, save for the kids college, have an emergency fund, etc. I am looking for a solution here.
mfwxv8	1617044886	249	I am a healthcare professional but didn’t get an opportunity to practice much because I couldn’t find a job in traditional work and went into research. However, thankfully having my background, I was able to be called upon to do some clinical tasks during times of need (such as the current pandemic). There was a time I wanted to be a doctor and go to medical school because I found the science aspect and helping people fascinating, but my biggest fear was the anxiety, depression and burnout people face as I already suffer from anxiety and depression and don’t think I’d be able to sleep at night knowing if every decision I made was a correct one. Even though my career wasn’t in medicine, a typical day in a traditional job entails working with a lot of people and I remember one lady who was interviewing me when I was a student broke down during the interview and told me that she struggles to deal with the people everyday that her husband tells her to quit her job. However, I love talking to people, love educating them or helping provide guidance. I am detached from such work as a researcher. I’m considering looking again for jobs in my field but am also just curious as to part time/side opportunities, even something like helping people with resume writing or work as a translator. Does anybody have experience working “with” people and would offer advice as to some jobs that are good.
m74vvs	1616000084	125	I didn't think burnout was real until it happened to me.  Or maybe I thought it was real but that it would never happen to me.  I don't know.  But I'm burnt out now and wow - it's a killer.  I'm just waiting for the hammer to fall because I'm barely scraping by at my job at the moment.  I'm keeping my head down and trying not to get in the way of some crashing projects while getting my resume together.  Also considering taking time off.I'm interested in others' stories of burnout and if/how they recovered if anyone would like to reply.  I'm sorry for anyone else going through this - it's frustrating, scary, and depressing among other things.
m6ndn6	1615940088	596	I'm going to turn 26 in a few days and have currently been unemployed for about 6 months. I got my BA in Media and Communication Studies (Literally just the STUDY of media. Not really applicable skills) because when I was a teenager my older brother told me that it would be versatile. The problem with that is that I certainly feel like I'm not really qualified to do anything. I pretty much got a degree that says I know how to study. I know not a lot of people end up following their degrees to a tee into their careers, but I wish I had a skill or specialty, you know? I didn't even want to go to college in the first place but went because of outside pressure. After I graduated, I interned at a tech place and helped with some of their internal communications, newsletter, and event planning, but overall I absolutely hated feeling trapped in my little cubicle. I felt like it sucked the life out of me and as a result, I never really tried to go above and beyond for that internship. That was totally my fault, but it happened. I was there for about 2 years. After that, I went to South Korea and taught English for a year and a half. I loved the kids and exploring, but the burnout was REAL. So I decided not to resign and came home.Now I'm stuck back in my parents' house due to covid, and have been looking for a job since I've been back. My mom does marketing and my dad is a technical writer, both wanting me to go into their respective fields. I know that I'm a good writer, and I always have been. However, as I've gotten older I've been finding that my dyslexia is getting worse. I sometimes help my mom make short videos for her company, and no matter how many times I proofread something, I end up calling a "Physician" a "Bysician" or turn "Gerentology" into "Yerenlotogy". I talked to my therapist about and she kind of agreed that maybe editing isn't the best thing for me. Though I've always had a dream of editing for a children's magazine lol (no, most aren't hiring-I've checked).I tell my parents that I don't really want to do what they're doing, and they get frustrated and ask me what it is that I DO want to do. And to that, I have no answer. I never really knew what I wanted to do. When I was in pre-school, my teacher asked me that too, but I didn't understand that question and simply answered, "I want to be a lady!". I know that I love to create, and can show a finished product as the fruit of my labor. But right now, especially in my area (suburban Maryland), the job market isn't the best. I also can't really find any creative jobs that would be able to give me benefits since I won't be able to be on my mom's plan once I hit 26. I'm just not sure what to do. What direction do you head in when you don't really have a passion, or the things you enjoy doing aren't going to be able to provide enough money or benefits? I just feel underqualified for everything or trapped. I know a job is a job and money is money. My therapist said as long as the job doesn't make me want to kill myself, it should be okay. But I still feel like that isn't quite right.

m67rpk	1615897141	138	Currently working as a Propefty adjuster at a Canadian insurance company (Ontario)Been in this role for almost a year now. They pay is decent at $51,000 but man is the burnout real. No matter what I do, I'm always playing catch up and having to deal with difficult insureds is not enjoyable and saps my energy. OT feels like it's mandatory if you want to stay caught up.I've been wondering about trying to make the switch to underwriting recently. I'm reading mixed results about the pay and growth opportunities and wanted to see if fellow Canucks had made the change themselves. I like the idea of not being customer facing quote a bit and if career prospects are there then adjusting would just seem inferior for my personality/ skillset.TIA for sharing your experiences, opinions and pay (if you're comfortable.)
m604bp	1615865858	141	Graduated 2 years ago with a BA in mech. engineering. First job was data processing (lied to in interview) and it took me 9 months to find my current job. Now my company is moving my facility and I need a new job, 1 year later. I want to switch to design work after doing manufacturing, and I want to move back to my home state(s) 6 hours away, but im getting no responses to my applications. All my coworkers have 10+ years experience and are getting interviews/offers/jobs left and right. I just feel like I've already failed at my career and I'm finished at 25. I don't have experience, but im far enough out from college I shouldn't be "entry-level" and im not sure where to go from here. Any advice welcome, on the job hunt or the imposter syndrome burnout

m5wx67	1615855829	417	I've been job searching for about a year now. My background is mainly in sales/marketing, but I realized that I wanted to pursue an old dream that I originally thought as naïve and unrealistic.During the pandemic, I did some soul searching and realized that I wanted to help businesses make better decisions, specifically ones that strengthened customer loyalty. Looking into careers, I found business analysis. After taking courses on SDLC, SQL, Tableau, and Excel, I decided to continue pursuing BA as a career.It's been a year since I've started job searching, and I still haven't been able to get one interview. I've revised my resume many times to show how my sales experience translates to the BA field, and included cover letters, but still nothing.I don't have experience in the BA field, despite studying the industry. For entry level positions, you need experience, but since I graduated college two years ago, I'm not eligible for internships, and I don't have the experience for contract positions.Recently I've been told to try networking with hiring managers on Linkedin. I tried that, not a lot of responses. Inquired about this approach on Reddit, apparently it's not a great way to get the attention of employers, especially if you don't have the experience many other candidates have to offer.I'm starting to slowly give up on becoming a BA. It's suggested that I look at financial analysis since it's easier to enter than the BA field. Looked into it, apparently it's still difficult for someone with my background to enter.&amp;#x200B;I'm so tired of this. It's like what I do is never enough. I do one thing to advance my chances, but apparently it's the wrong move. Maybe I should go back to school? Noooooo schooling isn't that great since experience is more important! Maybe I should get a certificate to get that experience? Nooooo, even with a certificate, you need experience to be accepted! Hmm mayb- NOPE!Job searching for a career that I can genuine be good at has been a harrowing and unfruitful experience that constantly reminds me that nothing I do will have employers give me a chance. A small part in me nudges me to keep going, but every time I go on job sites, I get filled with dread knowing that nothing will come out of applying.I'm this close to giving up and just staying in sales. I'm not sure if this is even worth my energy. **How do you guys keep going with job searching when nothing works?**
m5m5pi	1615819336	288	A bit of background. I currently work in mental health with a bachelors degree. I've hated both of the jobs I've had since graduating and I feel pretty miserable at the moment. There are a few parts of the job I enjoy and I think I'm good at. I've also had a few colleagues tell me they've been in my exact spot before (burnout) and that everything got better for them once they got their masters degree. So it's become clear to me recently that I need to continue my education. My therapist's advice however is that I should cleanse my palette career wise. In her words, going to grad school and keeping the job I have is "a lot of mental health, too much mental health". And that's probably gonna solidify my burnout even more. Once I get into grad school, I want that to be my main focus. And in the meantime, I want a job that pays decent, but will be easy to leave work at work. When I was in undergrad, I worked at my school's library and it was a dream. Pleasant coworkers, no drama, stress free, we were even encouraged to do our school work on the clock to promote an area of learning. If I could find a job like that for grad school, that would be amazing. Even if I can't do my school work on the clock, just something that I can clock in, do my work, clock out and not have to worry about it until my next shift starts. I was just wondering if a job like that exists and if it does if anyone has any suggestions as to what I should be typing into Indeed haha
m5bo6c	1615778847	810	Hello to anyone who reads this and thanks for taking the time to read this lengthy post. I am unsure of where I want to go career wise. Little bit of background knowledge: I have my B.A in Communication with a minor in P.R (this was just addes for extra pizzaz and I have no interest in P.R. for an extra class I was able to get it as a minor so I figured why not). Fresh out of college, I entered the Healthcare industry as a recruiter. The job was great, potential was there, but the burnout is real no matter where you are in Healthcare (IMO). I enjoyed the cold calls (provided they were people interested in working as care givers for the company I was with) and interacting with the employees. I would handle scheduling interviews, performing the interviews (I enjoyed doing interviews) discussing pay rates, setting them up with clients and putting together their schedule. (I was not the biggest fan of scheduling, but I was able to do it). I also went to events and networked with agencies to hopefully gain referrals for new clients looking for caregivers. I LOVED the networking aspect. Then I would do home visits with potential clients, present our services and how we could help them (enjoyed this part as well) and if they liked what we had to offer, we get the process started on getting them under our care. I also dealt with any problems that arose between clients and caregivers (I enjoyed that too being able to solve problems and getting both parties to work togethor). The main thing I didn't enjoy about that job and why I left was the long office hours during the week (50-60hr work weeks) the pay, and the on call schedule we had. I felt like there was a little time for personal life and the job itself drained me mentally. Also, I was pushed to go for a promotion by my manager and when I interviewed for the promotion, someone else from a different office got it and then my manager said he didn't think I was ready for it (I also tried leaving the company previously and I believe he used the promotion as a way to keep me, so when I didn't get it, that was the final straw). After my 2yr stint as a Healthcare Recruiter pretty much managing a business line by myself, I resigned and became a health and safety tech at a local battery manufacturing company. I have been here for 3½ years and am starting to feel stuck/complacent with my job and it is not challenging AT ALL. Money is great but I want more of a challenge. Currently, as a safety technician I do accident investigations, different audits, talk with new hires to make sure they are adjusting to the job accordingly, respond to/and clean up hazmat spills, perform consults for employees with elevelated Lead levels, and try to overall enforce safety policies and make sure everyone is doing what they are supposed to (I manage several buildings and do daily walk through visits). In a sense, people view me as a bad guy because of my title and for some reason I am the only rule enforcer (I don't mind being the bad guy, it's what I get paid for). I enjoy most of what I do as a safety tech but I don't agree with how the company goes about doing things. I also feel like safety is a joke at my job and no on enforces anything. I can't stand doing a job that has little importance. I like having meaning to my work. The downside is, the money is good and the benefits. Oh, I also wanted to mention, management is terrible and the lack of communication is unreal which is also attributing to me wanting something different now. If something were to pop up that peaks my interest job wise and it pays well with similar benefits, I would leave in a heartbeat.Which brings me here looking for advice. I don't know where I want to go after this or what I should even be looking for/applying to. What do I sound like I'd be a good fit for or I should consider looking into? Outside of work, I enjoy spreading information about people business and I always thought advertising or something of sorts would be interesting. (I constantly share friends and their small business on my social media and enjoy the thought of providing them more business). I'm also working on getting certified as a personal trainer because I enjoy helping people (which is why I wanted to be in Healthcare in the first place) and trying to live a healthy lifestyle. If you made it this far, thanks and I I looking forward to your advice!
m3v774	1615595547	153	I’m suffering from very real burnout in data analytics. I’ve been working in healthcare analytics for about 8 years doing everything from revenue management to dashboard / BI development and data warehousing / ETL work. I just graduated with my MBA from a state school , so it’s not like it’s a super sought after MBA but it would probably be enough to get me a middle management job if I wanted one. I really excel at and love data visualization. I love gathering requirements and figuring out how to fit 10 departments needs into a singular dashboard. That’s honestly what gives me more energy and passion for the field than anything. I’m not big into the data gathering, transformation, etc which is obviously a huge part of the job and starting to suffer from serious fatigue and burnout. Has anyone successfully moved into something else? Any recommendations on where to potentially go next?
m2pnkh	1615467971	235	I’ve already used half of my sick time and it’s only March.I make good money for a 22 M but I want to get into a career field I enjoy. This was only ever something to pay the bills. Now my hours have been cut and I have a mortgage and wife that I need to support. I work in manufacturing and running a 3-Axis water jet but I’ve always had a love for IT. I talked to a guy this weekend and he was a high up for a company that does IT and told me to email him my resume. Even if I don’t get this job I want to move into that field. I’ve never really know what I wanted to do until recent when I sat down and had an epiphany that I’ve always loved computers and tech and figuring out how they work. So my question is. Is there an accelerated course that could get my foot in the door? I’m sure there’s someone out there that’s been in the same boat as me. What did you do to get out of the rut and get into the field you wanted to be in!This is my second time trying to make this post. This one was about 1/10 of the last one where I ranted on for a while. Thanks for reading and I hope you all have a great day!
m1kefg	1615335235	186	Just like most office workers, I’ve been wfh for about a year now since COVID lockdown has started here in NYC. Even since that my hours I feel like have increased significantly. I work 10-12 hours a day constantly, sometimes can be more. I think being stuck in my apartment in nyc doesn’t  help either and now without commuting I rarely go outside. I would wake up, take a shower and login to my work right away, by the time I log off usually it’s already pretty late and I only have time to make dinner and maybe an hour or 2 for personal time. I also feel like there’s an increased pressure to be present, to have my status to be always online, I got anxious whenever I walk away from my computer even just to make coffee or go to bathroom. Sorry if I’m just ranting here. I’m feeling burnout, tired, and lately a bit suicidal. My work pay decent and idk if I can get paid the same if I leave, I just don’t see a light in the end. Just keep swimming?
m1i54s	1615328878	211	I currently work in the healthcare IT space (think the guys who design EMRs) as a consultant- specifically as it pertains to medical and financial reporting. I query in a language similar to SQL.I'm pretty bored of what I do. I know I'm good at it, I get great reviews/raises every year, but it is not very interesting. And all in all it's a very corporate culture/job.Prior to getting this job I got a B.S. in Biology with an emphasis on medicine. My GPA wasn't the best 3.2 or 3.3, I don't remember. I had then applied to PA school and got waitlisted by 2 schools and rejected by 3. That kind of kicked the life out of me and so I got this job. I wouldn't mind pursuing something in the medical field, but I'm finding it hard to find the motivation. Given my GPA, I'd be looking at re-taking quite a few classes to be competitive enough to get into any program. Additionally, I make ok money (~60k/year), and I'd like to start out with a salary somewhere near that mark.I'm unsure of where to start, if I should be looking on improving my IT skills or go in an entirely different direction. All I know is healthcare and IT.

m18azn	1615302426	74	I have been in software sales for about 5 years now and I may be experiencing sales burnout. I'd like to switch roles but unsure what I can pivot to with my sales background, while maintaining a good salary and having room for growth. Those that pivoted away from sales, what roles did you move to? How do you like it? How does the pay compare? Any insight you can share will be greatly appreciated.
m0zjyq	1615267118	411	This post is going to start out negative, but I promise it won't end that way. I am finishing up my engineering degree (I won't say which discipline- I may know people who check this page) and it's definitely not been fun. I have been far from the best engineering student on the planet. It's ultimately due to three things- low motivation/burnout, the sheer difficulty of some semesters, and my poor time management. My prior shortcomings as an engineering student killed my motivation a long time ago, and there's definitely things I'm more interested in. I am also a terrible procrastinator (especially when not motivated), who makes it work by burning the midnight oil and getting lucky. Combine that with some painfully intense engineering semesters, and it just sucks. I feel like it ruined college for me. I have also never had an internship.I originally went into engineering because I wanted to work in renewable energy or some other environmental tech, and I haven't completely given up on that. The problem is, I am not a particularly heavy lifter, and considering the lousy (and frankly, overrated) job market for my specific discipline of engineering, that matters. It was kind of bleh before covid hit. School has also made me a little sick of engineering, as you may have guessed.I have always had big interests in politics, foreign affairs, geography, outdoorsy stuff, and environmental stuff, and I do plan on "Returning" to those interests whenever I look at graduate degrees down the road, or sooner. Though my experience (and thus knowledge of what I like/don't like) is limited, I want a job that deals with something physical and is hands on. I am most interested in jobs where I feel like I am helping make a difference, particularly when it comes to high profile environmental issues such as global warming and growing water shortages. I like to see the physical improvements I help make. I like outdoorsy jobs. Concerning my innate political interests, I think that working for the State Department could be a dream. But being real, I'm currently a beggar not a chooser.THE POINT: Whenever the job market tanks, or whenever you go down a path in life that you don't completely like, your success can depend a lot on your ability to think (and look) outside the box. I am trying to figure out what careers I should investigate that are outside the box; any/all ideas and suggestions are welcome.Thanks!
m0st31	1615245007	116	I’m 25 and currently unemployed. I quit my old job three months ago due to mental health issues. I just could not handle the burnout, at the same time working overtime and unusual hours took a toll on my physical health. Along the way in that job, I have tried looking for other jobs and I got some good offers but due to my fear for change and disrupting the stability I have in my previous job, I rejected a few of them. Now that I am unemployed, I look back and kinda regret rejecting these offers because I think I might be in a better situation right now if I just quit my previous job immediately.
m0psz0	1615236802	87	I work for a F50 Corp in finance (healthcare/pharma so we were well positioned in 2020) and have been working remotely since March. I’ve rotated twice in that time and I’m in a role where I’ve never met any of my colleagues in person. I feel like the lack of work/home separation, lack of structure, lack of interaction with coworkers, and sitting at home alone staring at a computer is taking a significant toll on my mental health and impacting my work. How are you guys handling this?
lxy0zj	1614899287	208	Hi, I’m a NYC based young marketing professional. I’ve been busting my butt and delivering since I joined my beauty company over a year ago. But I’ve been struggling with burnout due to our project timelines being severely affected COVID-19 (all of our vendors are in China). I know my performance has been impacted and, even worse, it’s the only thing my boss brought up during my performance review and it’s really made me become insecure. Despite my struggles, I know I’ve made huge accomplishments and our small team has been recognized for its efforts.Now - I want to ask for a raise because business is booming despite COVID-19. But I’m afraid my boss will only focus on my struggles. I’m only saying this because when I expressed to her that I feel burnt out and needed help, she suggested that I wasn’t using my time productively since I wasn’t getting it done as fast as her. Mind you, she’s a director and I’m a fresh assistant manager. I was blown away by her lack of sympathy. Do I have a leg to stand on here? Is it even worth pursuing? I’m so stuck in my own anxiety I have no idea how to proceed. Any advice is welcome.

lxl7vz	1614866646	80	Hi All!How to overcome burnout? For over a month I have been increasingly discouraged with my work, lacking any motivation. I am tired of my responsibilities, the company culture, and my co-workers. I feel like I have no strength left and I would quit my job even today without a plan b. I feel frustrated. Mood generated by work also spills over into other areas of my life. Have any of you been in a similar situation? How did you cope?A.
lt68wf	1614369263	726	I got a Bachelor’s in psychology when I was pretty young, not really knowing what exactly I wanted to do with it but I’m lucky that I was able to work in a social services position after I graduated. This position was all right; it paid somewhat decently as any other kind of case manager type position, although certainly not a lot (about 20,000$ for a year and I worked part time for most of it). I’m married, so I rely mostly on my husband’s income, but of course my income helped us. He makes around 40K a year. We can get by on his income alone; there isn’t much left over for any extras like vacations or a lot of eating out at restaurants, but we at least can get by. I’m in about $35,000 worth of student loans for my degree. My goal had always been to get my Master’s degree and to become a therapist, but when I got married I decided to just dive right into work, save up some money, and together we hoped to have kids so I could become a stay at home mom eventually. For more background, we have been trying to conceive a child for over two years but it just hasn’t worked out. That door isn’t closed for us per se, but it costs us money to try with the doctors each time. So far we are pushing $7,000 in just to try to have a baby so far, and still without success. Some of this I paid for out of pocket when I was working and some of it is in credit card debt. It’s unclear if we will need IVF eventually or if our current mode of treatment will eventually work. So, with COVID affecting healthcare dramatically and with our infertility diagnosis, my mental health kind of spiraled. I also had a long commute for my job, and I ended up quitting (well, I asked to become PRN, so my foot is in the door at least, but it’s unclear whether I’ll ever really be asked to come in to work again). I ended up becoming a housewife basically, which was a good thing for me to sort of recuperate and focus on our fertility treatments and focus on some house repairs that needed done. Well, after some time, I find myself at a crossroads. I know I can’t stay depressed and at home forever. I know that when it comes to employment I’m not very good at pushing myself to stay in a full time position, and the jobs I’m suited for at this point really aren’t what I originally dreamed of doing for myself. Again, I’d gone to college originally with hopes of becoming a therapist. But in order to become one, I’d need to go another $30,000 in debt to get my Master’s degree and licensure. For someone who struggles to work full-time, and really only sees herself ever working part-time if I can help it and get by on it, I just don’t know if this is worth it, even though I feel this would be a more fulfilling job position for me. On the other side of the coin, my dreams of becoming a stay at home mom are still there, but... after two years, I feel kind of ridiculous for putting my life on hold for something that still hasn’t happened. We have no idea when we will ever finally become pregnant. We’re trying, but it’s not cheap, and it might just keep getting more and more expensive as the months and possibly even years go by. So, at this point I don’t know if I should go back to school in order to pursue my career dreams of becoming a counselor again, to sort of help give myself some sort of purposeful role as I wait until we possibly become parents, and also so that I have a backup life plan/career in case we don’t ever become parents. I could work a case manager job again to make some more money, but like I said, these positions are highly prone to cause burnout and don’t pay the greatest—in fact many of these sorts of jobs are quite dangerous—and are not what I see myself doing in the long-term at all. Thoughts on this situation from an outsider’s perspective?
lsleg1	1614299687	123	I'm almost graduating with a BSc in Psychology and am considering continuing with a Master's in Neuroscience. So far my education has been very research oriented, and while intrinsically I find the content very interesting and the idea of discovering and exploring the field more excites me, I'm not sure if research is really for me. From what I hear, those who pursue PhDs are very stressed out, often get a burnout and feel very unrewarded and underpaid for their work. I'm not sure if that is a work environment I'm willing to spend the rest of my life on. Has anyone else here done a PhD or continued/tried research (regardless of the field) and maybe has any tips, advice or experiences to share?

lqtyjf	1614116744	937	I'm at a loss and I don't know where else to turn. Here goes nothing....I started my current job 4 months before the pandemic started. It was the perfect job for me, experience wise, and it was a miracle I had gotten it --I had been unemployed for 3 months and was recovering from the burnout and heartache of quitting my last job. My current job nearly tripled my take home salary and gave me benefits, plus a bunch of other perks I had never had. When I first started, I hit the ground running, determined to learn and master my role quickly and prove myself. This job was the best thing that ever happened to me. I worked my ass off for months.Prove myself, I did. Not only am I the only person in my department (a department that basically didn't even exist until I got hired), and one of the youngest on my team, I don't have a direct supervisor that's truly familiar with the ins and outs of my role and what it should encompass. My boss basically left me alone in my office for the first few months of my job, only giving me a few assignments here and there and basically relied completely on my ability to work independently without supervision. My boss and colleagues were (and still are surprisingly) very impressed with what I've been able to accomplish in such a short time. But they're so wrong. And I'm not being hard on myself. I'm being honest with myself.After my role transitioned to be being primarily work from home, my productivity tanked, mostly for obvious reasons. I haven't worked a full 8 hour shift in probably an entire year and no one has noticed or complained. I mean, there are days when I barely get 1 full hour of actual work done. There were days, especially at the beginning, where I didn't do anything at all for work because I assumed I'd be getting canned soon anyway due to budget cuts and the world was seemingly ending. As a result of getting paid very well for the absolute bare minimum (and sometimes it's even less than that), it's been hard for me to get motivated or go back to being self-directed or figure out what I'm even supposed to be doing for my job.Sometimes I feel like if I had the type of job that just required mindless activity until it was time to clock out, I would be very good at it. If my boss literally told me what to do and how to do it at every turn, I could do it and be done with it and probably not have an anxiety attack every time I have to work a day at our physical office and I don't know how to fill up 8 hours of my time. Sometimes I think of everything I could have accomplished my now if I actually did work 8 hours everyday from the start of the pandemic. I would be way further ahead and maybe I'd even have strong enough skills to consider taking on a similar role in a different company.As it stands now, I barely feel qualified to do my own job well. When I try to apply for new jobs I realize that although my current role could have and SHOULD have prepared me for, at minimum, a lateral career move, it hasn't because I've been coasting all year. I don't even know how I'd go about starting over somewhere new and at this point, I'm not used to working anymore.My coworkers are constantly telling me how great I am, how inspiring I am, how happy they are that I've joined the team. It's because the few projects I have completed had an impact they could actually see (for example I organized a community food drive completely by myself, but I mostly did it by myself because I procrastinated so much I couldn't reasonably ask anyone for assistance). Stuff like that makes me look really good but if someone that actually specialized in my role could see what I'm doing (and not doing), they'd know it actually makes me look really bad.Idk if it helps but I work in communications and outreach, which is not my official title (nor what I expected my role to be when I took on this position) but after being here a year it basically sums up at least 70% of what I am responsible for. I never thought I'd be an outreach/strategic communications person and it's probably why I'm struggling right now. I don't know half of what I should know by now to perform at this role effectively, there is no training available and I no longer seem to have the ability to manage myself. I would probably enjoy my role more if I knew how to do it well (for example understanding how to lead a direct marketing campaign and how to use all the tools that requires) or maybe if I had more experience. If I quit (which I won't), I probably wouldn't even know how to train my replacement. In all likelihood they'd more qualified and more effective at this role than I am.Does anyone have advice for me? I'm a literal emotional wreck every other week as a result of this and my job is only getting more demanding. Idk how much longer I'll get away with faking it. I don't want to ask my boss for help because if she knew just how much I was sitting around getting paid for nothing she'd fire me in a second.
lpvv51	1614018518	396	M35, Saskatchewan, Canada. I’m thinking that it’s time for a career change, and would like some advice. Last year I suffered a stroke, it left me mildly disabled on my left side, but thankfully nothing that affects me too greatly. I’ve since resumed my life and job. However, my tolerance for stress has gone down exceptionally, and seeing as the vast majority of my stress is from work, I’m looking at starting something else. I currently work as an union organizer for the union that represents my trade in Canada. I’ve been in the trade and a member of the union since I was 18 (now 35) and have made my way through both company and union ranks. I never went to university because my whole life I’ve made excellent money in the trades. When oil crashed in 2015 I left working on the tools as a foreman/site superintendent and started working directly for the union as the full time organizer. Which was a smart career move since employment was almost non-existent during a few of those years. During my time as organizer Ive been elected and served as an executive board member with my union and now sit as it’s Vice President. My plan prior to the stroke was to continue serving our membership and eventually run in an election to serve as the business manager for our local union. Burnout among union organizers is an occupational hazard and I am the longest serving organizer in my area-it’s an incredibly high stress job, and most people I’ve seen get into it only last a year or two before quitting and moving on to other things. I feel motivated by fighting for workers rights, serving others, and seeing the positive changes I can influence but I can no longer handle the bureaucracy, expectations, and fighting that is required to properly execute a union drive. I’ve been looking at how I can upgrade the skills I have and move into a role where the stress would be reduced and I would not have to bare the weight of my organizations survival singlehandedly. I’ve been looking at the university of Athabasca’s bachelors degree in Human Resources and Labour Relations  and feel that it may open some doors. I’m open to all suggestions and advice that you can offer, and happy to answer questions or provide any clarification. Thanks!
lorugh	1613892749	45	I have recently had to let a dream die due to injury and burnout. I would like to be a career gal, and am just struggling to find something that I can be equally passionate about. Looking for advise and any personal stories. Thanks in advance
lmdny1	1613622427	311	I spent 2020 burning out. I’m in my early twenties and have been lucky enough to find work in media where I live. But working in media during a global pandemic simply burned me out. I couldn’t come up with story ideas, could barely write, and constantly had brain fog. I started therapy (ongoing), tried yoga, journaling... tried telling myself everyone is going through it.... but I could barely sleep, was crying every night, and became a shell of myself in six months. I decided to quit. And not for lack of trying/success (I don’t want to share too much info about where I lived/work because the industry is small, but I’ve had a few jobs and didn’t walk away from an internship)I took a month off and accepted the first job that came my way—marketing for a startup. I’m a month in and I’m finding it extremely difficult. The brain fog is back, I’m working 10-11h days, on a short-staffed team, am already missing deadlines and the work keeps piling up. I try communicating that it is too much work but things don’t change. I know it’s a pandemic, that I’m lucky to have a job, that I shouldn’t job hop, etc, but I’ve been working through a headache since starting this job and feel myself working towards a burnout again. Any advice/tips? Is it me? Or should I consider a new industry altogether? Something less creative/cerebral to get me back to balance? I’m realizing deadline-oriented, content churning, kpi-tracking work isn’t for me. I don’t have the headspace to track/manage multiple projects and meet with 10 partners a week. I’m scared because it feels like this is all the “real world” is about.I wish I could just take a huge break from life.Does it sound like I’m burning out again, have a bad job, or need better coping skills?Thanks for reading.
lkteou	1613442007	333	Could someone please help me out. I know i have a little while until i have to actually choose a major/ career path but i really want to pour all of my time and energy into one field. I would like to be able to choose classes specific to the field im going into so that i can be better prepared. I was going to go into psychology and become a therapist so that i could help people. i have a natural talent for it and I have always found it super interesting, but the more i thought about it i  realized wouldn’t be able to deal with others mental health without it taking a major toll on my own. I wouldnt want to do anything other then therapy though. Plus from the data i have seen the job market is already flooded. Then i thought about pharmacy but the more i looked into it the more i didn’t want to do it. The job security and burnout seem to much. I dont have the stomach for most healthcare jobs, i dont think i would be good at anything related to the tech field, and the stress of law would kill me. Im completely lost and i feel suffocated having to make the right choice or take a chance and be stuck in something i hate. Every time i think i have made a choice i look deeper into the career and realize its not promising or interesting to me. I would prefer a high paying job 80-100k. Leave work at work, not have to work with a lot of people. I dont really care about long hours or holidays. School really isnt an issue. Im ok with going for 6-8 years, maybe even longer if i had to. Im pretty smart and adaptive. I would love to be able to help people in some way. I dont even care if its just a mindless job. Administrative maybe. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
lj7wjd	1613246357	261	So I'm 41 and work in finance, and not only am I approaching burnout at my current job, but in general I dislike the work. I didn't go to school for it, I studied music and have been a songwriter and a writer for basically my whole life. Finance just kinda happened by accident, as a day job and then snowballed over the years. But my natural inclination is towards creative pursuits.I really want to make a change. So, despite not liking my current role, I do like my current company (creative agency) and am speaking with HR next week about a possible transfer to a junior copywriter role. Not sure how well it will go over, but they've been open to stuff like this in the past.What is some advice or things you might consider if you were in my situation?How do I best pitch this to the company so it seems sensible from their perspective, not just for me?Also, for those who have changed careers (especially later in life) what was it like for you? How did you go about it? Anything you'd do differently in retrospect?It's a sensitive process, because if they say no, I don't know if they automatically assume that I'm not committed to doing my current job. I do want to leave that role in time, but if they deny the transfer, I would stay on where I am at least until I found another job.Anyway, any thoughts or experiences or advice would be appreciated. Trying to get a sense of how best to approach this.
livgyx	1613199614	406	I've been in automotive engineering in the Detroit area for about 25 years. I've been out of work for over a year now, mainly due to COVID, and staying with my kids while they school from home. I have little time to do anything else right now because they aren't managing it real well, so I spend a good 6-8 hours a day just helping them get through their school day. I'm a single parent, so I need to get my ass back to work eventually, hopefully by this fall when schools should hopefully open up full time face to face.I'm in my late 40's, and I hate engineering, despite getting a degree and working for 25 years in the field. I only did the jobs I did because they paid well and I was decent at them. But I hated pretty much every minute of it. Always the need to travel looming over my head, unexpected extended hours, not to mention the horrible commute added to burnout.Despite the financial burden of being off work, I can't see myself getting back into automotive engineering when I start looking again. But I don't know if there's much opportunity elsewhere for an old fart like me.I have always had an interest in computers and networking and can repair and build PC's, laptops, NAS devices and small electronics without a sweat for the most part. I enjoy converting analog media to digital. And have dabbled a bit with photo and video editing for fun. I'm only marginally good at any of these things, not great. Plus being older, I don't think I'd have the chops to go up against the recent college grads or 20 somethings that have more energy, fewer family restrictions, more motivated (I've been beaten down by the system so to speak), and let's face it, likely less pay.Working from home would be ideal, or at least flexibility to work from home part of the time so I can manage my personal life with my kids. No travel at all preferable.I guess I'm just babbling on to see if anyone has any recommendations going forward? Worse case, I feel I should be able to get an engineering job again if I really need to with my experience, and I probably undervalue myself anyhow, just because I suck at and hate negotiating salaries. But I just don't want to get back into engineering if I can help it.
lid5so	1613143302	326	My company, like most, was impacted by the pandemic. A month in, my hours were cut by 20% (almost everyone’s hours were). We also had to layoff some people. My position, luckily, was pretty pandemic proof and I still had the same responsibilities but now with the bonus of transitioning everything to digital (my work can be very archaic and LOVES paper). While figuring this all out, I also was given the responsibilities of some of the laid off workers. Needless to say, it was an incredibly stressful time professionally. I was thankful to still have a job, but the burnout of doing twice the work with 20% less time and compensation was really wearing on me and making me resentful. Towards the end of 2020 my hours were returned to normal, but I still kept the additional responsibilities. In the next few months my department (very small, 3-4 total) will be changing as my boss is retiring and my other boss is taking his role. I am excited for this change and know my new boss will update and improve how we do things. She had a meeting with me last week asking if I had any ideas for updating our department structure and roles. I know hiring and promotions/raises are tough right now, but I do feel that I deserve a promotion given the added responsibilities I have had over my four years here (not only during the pandemic). I would ideally be able to take on some other roles fully and change my position to better reflect where I am now versus when I was hired. I work for a non-profit, I know things are tough budget wise, but I also know my position is subsidized my state government. I have never asked for a raise or promotion, but I feel this is the opportunity to do so. I am just wondering how to handle this in the current climate? Any help is appreciated!
li1yap	1613098463	667	Hey all, I've been thinking a lot about my career lately and I'm going to try not to ramble too much. Any suggestions or support or even criticism is welcome.I've been a software engineer at a tip tier tech company for 5 years. I worked also about 5 years before that at early and mid-stage start-ups. My current job pays me an extremely high salary for very little work. The work that I do is so unbelievably boring and bureaucratic that I can't even get myself to do even an hour of it a day. It's usually trying to figure out why a bloated and old piece of software that I didn't write is failing. The output is not even looked at by anyone, save maybe 1 or 2 other employees. The solutions to the issues I'm assigned usually involve several weeks of bureaucratic processing or else poking someone across the company to address an issue out of my control.I try to tell myself that I could just work an hour or two a day and spend the rest of my time on things I find interesting, but it just doesn't happen. I spend all day procrastinating my work, only to just not do it anyway. My managers protest about this and give me performance ratings that reflect it, but those ratings just mean that my already enormous salary won't grow as quickly as it would if I tried really hard. Even in the latter case, it's become clear that promotions almost don't exist in my part of the org, and meaningful career advancement is not a possibility. I would need to seriously climb the latter before the extra money would substantially change my life. I have also struggled with a repetitive stress injury that means that I cannot depend on myself physically to code many hours a day/week.I've felt miserable for years and I really want to make a change, but I suspect that I will regret giving up such a cushy and lucrative gig. Moreover, I worry that my burnout/depression/constitutional indolence or whatever it is will not actually respond to a "more interesting" job. On top of that, anything really engaging or higher pressure will likely overwhelm my physical ability.My expertise is in the ever hot, ever hyped, machine learning and data science area. I have a BS and MS from top tier schools. I have always loved math. Before my current job I worked in a capacity more aligned with my expertise. It was occasionally interesting, but to be honest, after working on a lot of ML products they all started to feel the same and rather tedious and/or delusional. Data problems. Dashboards. Product managers obsessed with a random edge case. Endless hours of tweaking hyperparameters for gains that were, in my opinion, mostly imaginary. My experience has been that a team of 5-10 people with advanced degrees all grind away on some particularly fetishized metric for years, when a generalist could have implemented a reasonable heuristic in a few weeks that would perform 80-90% as well and far more robustly. These teams often suffer from the "when all you have is a hammer" issue, where everyone is in a rush to make use of their fancy knowledge to solve every problem, but the problem is often better solved by, for example, a more thoughtful UI for the user, or an investment in better training data. I think that I would like to work more like the generalist I mentioned above, framing problems and implementing a reasonable and robust solution and moving on to the next thing. I also have various side project ideas that I'd love to work on by my lack of motivation and stress injury tend to get in the way.I don't have any really specific questions, but just wondering if where I'm at makes sense to anyone and if anyone would be interested in sharing their experience and perhaps making some suggestions about what I might do next. Thanks for reading!
lhnwpc	1613059737	326	Hello all,TLDR: Does anyone have any suggestions for low-stress office jobs with low-barrier of entry that I would be qualified for with a broad college degree but minimal work experience?My life, like many others, has not gone the route that I expected. I graduated with a degree that was a combination of business/economics/sociology while also minoring in media studies. I loved the breadth of classes I got to take but the downside is I didn’t have a specific topic of expertise when I graduated. After graduating in 2018 I have since fizzled out with some issues involving mental health. With the pandemic hopefully nearing its end soon, I’m eager to jump out of my previous rut and enter the workforce. The problem I face is a huge lack of employment experience. I have done a lot of volunteer work at animal shelters to fill the gap after graduating but I know it doesn’t have the same weight as work experience. I have been learning Python but I’m still a beginner as well as looking to earn some certs for IT. I’m not keen on 100% customer service style jobs as it would give me burnout as an introvert but I’m fine talking with people (just don’t want it to be the focal point of my job). I’m just at this point in my life where I know I didn’t utilize my time well after graduating but there’s nothing I can do to change the past. When I imagine a job that makes me happy I see myself working in an office environment where I can work on tasks in solitude or working with coworkers on a common goal. I know it sounds weird but I imagine the Parks and Rec TV Show lol. I don’t need to make bank, I just want stability more than anything right now to give me some structure. Would greatly appreciate some advice or even some personal anecdotes on jumpstarting your careers.Thanks!
lfsa4i	1612837257	80	Hello fellow Redditors, so I just quit my retail wireless job as a manager. I'm in my 30s. Have a wife and kid. Panic is obviously kicking in. Have some savings 16k. I studied HR during my BBA degree. The job I quit took too much of my time, sales targets and the stress and burnout was eventually going to happen. Any advice of someone who is back in the job hunt in their 30s with a wife a kid ?
lcgxmy	1612449374	82	34 year old man in Texas. Chronic pain. Diagnosed with autism. Get severe meltdowns, burnout, and self harm when working. Unable to work for more than a day or two at a time without suicide attempts. I also cannot drive.Unfortunately I am not eligible for disability benefits. I've been denied by 3 judges and the Social Security Appeals council. Lawyers have told me that it's over. No lawyer will take my case now.What options do I have now other than homelessness or suicide?
lbz92g	1612388829	89	Curious to know what your progression was. I just graduated school, had two healthy communications and product marketing internships under my belt, and accepted a role as a sales development rep for a medical software company. &amp;#x200B;While fortunate to have the opportunity, my heart is oriented towards product marketing/management. I'm even taking courses to sharpen my data analytics and project management skills. SDR is.....fine. I just can't seem to escape the idea that I'll burnout fast in an unfulfilling role. &amp;#x200B;Anyone else start your career on the customer facing side?
lbxt3h	1612385243	1195	 Hi guysI'm posting this in part to vent, in part because I genuinely wish for some advice, or at least thoughts.I started working at my current company almost exactly one year ago as a teamleader for a backoffice team. This company is a worldleader in it's sector so I was ecstatic to be chosen out of all the candidates. I already had some experience as a manager, but not yet in managing a large team of 14 people, all with different ways of working depending on their client(s).  I knew going in that this was going to be a challenge. Not only because I am a relatively young manager (in my 30's) but also because the previous teamleader had gone into a burn-out and the team hadn't had a manager for a year. People were managing themselves, which does tend to lead to certain complications.  Also, I started in full lock-down, so I would be and still am leading them from a distance.However, it's more complicated than I thought.  The company is incredibly archaic and political. There are a thousand and one splintered departments, each with their own sense of self importance. The systems used are outdated mainframe systems, which wouldn't be too bad, but there's a complete lack of IT support, because the people who knew the systems are either retired, left the company or in burn-out. There is a lot of burn-out in the company over all, a lot of people are working on off hours, weekends and during their vacation. Everyone is constantly "on". There is also a lot of pressure from the higher management to preform. And the company is very political, you have to be very diplomatic and watch your words with everyone. People/managers won't hesitate to throw other teams under the bus.Aside from that there are also very frequent management changes and while the company does have a plan running on speed to uniformize and get some structure in this draconian example of decade long mismanagement, the entire project is all over the place, everybody hates it and nobody believes in it. This is mainly because the people leading the project are using it as their own prestige project and aren't taking the daily workload into account.We are understaffed. Almost every department is, but there's no budget for new people. When someone leaves my team, or when I signal that I want to replace a low performer, I get told that they can only be outsourced. It takes about 3 months to get an ok to outsource 1 FTE, and another month to get them to understand the scope of the tasks, to finally get the response that they can only take 1/3rd of the tasks due to the complexity of the material. Which still leaves my team understaffed and overworked.  Atomization isn't an option either, because either the tasks are too complex, or when it's not, the volumes are so large that it's deemed too expensive.I'm exhausted.  I'm regularly working form 9 am to 21 pm, sometimes even till 24h or 1 am.  In my opinion I haven't been able to achieve any real change. I've not been able to create an environment where I or my team can work normal hours. I'm sleeping really badly, having dreams about my team and the things I'm trying to change. And since December I've been breaking down crying so so much. Even in front of my team a few times now...  I haven't felt so emotionally fragile since I was much younger and dealing with self-worth issues.And on the other hand, my team loves me and completely unexpected; the company loves me too :/  My boss (who also hates this company, but doesn't feel like the market is interesting for him) adores me. He supports my judgement and decisions. And he backs me when others are being unnecessarily difficult. I'm his back-up in case anything would ever happen to him.  Upper management is so positive about me that when the teamleader of another department fell into burnout and quit, they wanted to add that team to my team.  People who aren't functioning in other teams are constantly being added to mine (I've got 17 people now instead of the 14 I started with).We got a new international head of operations in January and he's a lot harsher than the previous one. And with that harshness, he seems to be getting things done, and maybe, maybe things will get better.  But first they'll probably get a lot worse. And if I stay, I'm going to have to push things onto my people, that some won't be able to take. and force them to anyway. I can see us losing clients, and more people falling into burn-out, and I hate the thought of being responsible for that.There's already a raise in my future in April. If I stay, my boss promised me that he'll also fight to get me a raise next year. So, my efforts will be paid. I know money isn't the world, but I grew up in a situation where my parents were bankrupt, living in a small crappy house with crickets in the walls and hand me down clothes. They gave everything to get me a good education, make sure I have a university degree. They haven't saved anything for their retirement, so I'm personally really focused on having a large income and being able to give myself and my parents the comfort/luxury we couldn't have when I was a kid.  But it also makes me feel dirty, like a sell-out. Unless the endstate really does end up a better company for the people I guess...I'm feeling very conflicted.  If I stay, I'm going to stay in this exhausting situation, and probably have to become a lot harder as a person. I'm a soft manager, I'm going to have to be more of an old school dictator type manager.  If I go, my best options are a consulting firm in my sector, which has the same level of workload but at least none of the bullshit politics.  Or I can leave the sector, and earn less but hopefully have a more normal schedule and life.But, if I go, I'm also going to leave a crater. There's going to be no filter anymore for all the extra work being pushed onto them. And I do love my current manager. He only started 3 months before me when this company took over the company he used to work for. I have never had such a good and compassionate manager. And I'd hate to leave him in this shit hole.So I guess my question is;  \- do I prioritize my state of mind and get out of here asap and start applying tomorrow?  \- do I tough it out another few months, wait till I get my pay raise / bonus, and try to get the team in a state where they can function for a bit without me?  \- or do I stick with it, hoping that things really do get better...?

lb2p0y	1612290550	331	**Guidance and Advice needed: Did you change from the public sector to the private sector? Advice? Recommendations?**I am in my early 30s and have spent the last 4 years working for the local city government for a parks and recreation department.  I have a true appreciation for my salary, benefits, and perks that come with my job, just not the job itself. My job has led to me being very unhappy, feelings of the Sunday scaries, and just general burnout feeling. A feeling that I have had for at least a year and half/2 years and has escalated during COVID. My job responsibilities have shifted because of this *unprecedented* time. My gut feeling is COVID will very much be affecting my summer job responsibilities (running summer camps) and I just can't anymore.**What I enjoy about the job** is the perks/benefits. Since I have entered my 30s I am more aware of **Retirement** and since my job contributes to a **Pension** and not a 401k I am wary of changing jobs. I don't want to screw myself over in the future, but also thinking what about present me? Am I right to be fearful and cautious about leaving? If I am already feeling this way about my job, I worry for how I will feel down the line. The Pandemic isn't making it easy to job search and I am fearful of losing job security if I leave, but also need to look out for my own mental health.  Pre COVID and during COVID the Department and work situation feels like a functional dysfunctional, which makes it hard to stick it out. Other info that might be relevant... No job advancement in my department (at least for 15+years). Bad communication and lack of direction and transparency from leadership. There is a high talk of being a team, but in reality all work is done on individual basis.  Supervisors like to talk the talk but not walk the walk. Thank you!

l79shz	1611870176	121	I’m currently struggling with burnout from a career in sales over the past 5 years. After getting a degree in Chemistry I’ve moved into sales and had lots of success but found myself struggling with some of the entrepreneurial sides of things like prospecting. I’m hoping for suggestions on a pivot I can make that Keeps me in research/science/pharma as I love talking science, but due to anxiety I get very shaky and don’t handle high dexterous jobs well. I greatly enjoy more task driven jobs where I have clear direction to execute on rather than more nebulous guidance like “build a pipeline”. Does anyone have suggestions on careers I should explore? I’m not opposed to getting more schooling if required. Thanks!
l6wre9	1611841036	186	I’m really torn between the two. I’ve been working in mental health the past 5 years and while I enjoy it, the pay has been terrible and I’ve been dealing with some burnout. I could go get my MSW, but it would be more expensive, harder to get into with my grades, and even with a MSW I may be limited and won’t be making THAT much more. OTA seems really interesting, although different, but it would still be healthcare and helping others and I’d be able to make more, plus the program would be cheaper and shorter. It’s tough because I’m 27 and still living at home paying off debts which has added a lot of stress to my life. I know I shouldn’t go into social work for the money but I would want to get licensed and eventually work in a private practice if I were to do that. I’ve heard that occupational therapy is an amazing field with a ton of opportunities PLUS it’s growing and even as an OTA I’d possibly make as much as I would with a MSW. Any ideas?

The LOA was recommended by my psychologist for mental health / burnout reasons.I interviewed for jobs before going on LOA, and got an offer at another company (to start in a few months). I wanted to take LOA to heal &amp; make an informed decision about my next steps, and didn't expect this new company to start doing full background checks so soon.Now (while only 2 days into LOA) the background check company called my current employer HR to verify employment. HR called me asking why and what it's about. What am I obligated to tell HR right now?
l4pujc	1611587867	180	I’m 30, have a business bachelor’s degree and my work experience consists of me running my small family business due to clinical depression/burnout. I always wanted to delve into sustainability and work at something meaningful, where I can feel like I’m making a difference. However, I’ve been told too many times that it is not a lucrative field, and with everything that’s going on now, I need to make sure I don’t shoot myself in the foot. I have no debt, 30K in savings, car, no kids or family to be responsible for. I was accepted into a MSc data analytics program, full ride. I decided to switch into IT because of the high demand, even though I don’t particularly enjoy the field, but business is quite a common degree and with innovation and automation, computing skills are becoming a must. I just want to make sure that I’m making the right decision... with so many people saying that if you do what you love you’ll never work a day in your life, I’m at a crossroads with what to do.
l4jrfl	1611564093	202	My fiancee and I are both employed (UK) but neither one is particularly happy in our work ( we've both taken jobs out of a perceived lack of options rather than any vocational calling). We're both open to ideas for something more satisfying and would definitely contemplate working together (I know, not for everyone) in our own business, but it may take time for the right idea to come along.Me:HNC in Building StudiesMany years of CAD experience in structural/civil/mappingFormer pro photographer with experience in Adobe suiteOpen to physical work, enjoys creating and problem solvingGood with written communicationsHer:Former successful business owner (sole trader)Many years in recruiting (before burnout)Currrently student nurseInterest in interior design, writing, advanced yoga/pilates, talented researcher&amp;#x200B;We both have relatively stable jobs, which is a huge bonus during a pandemic. However I'm returning to design work after years away as a photographer and she is finding nursing to be extremely challenging for her mental health. I hope to try project management but I'd love to find a business idea that would work for us both. We have low expenses and just want to make the best use of our skills while doing something we enjoy. I'd appreciate any suggestions for either of us!
l4bu1l	1611535160	61	I know about the concept of stay at home jobs but I dont have internet at home. I just want to get away from having to wear masks all the time, lifting heavy stuff and dealing with customers because I have severe anxiety issues, back issues and burnout and covid fatigue is not working. Id appreciate any recommendations for jobs like this.
l1vlpb	1611223407	381	I'm in Queensland, Australia and currently working in market research and analysis. I was enjoying it for a good while, but Covid-19 has put things into perspective and I'm reconsidering what I really want to do. Part of that I'm sure is just burnout, but part of that is definitely an accumulated apathy to constant output that just makes an already big company turn over a profit. I also hate the mindless work that seems unnecessary - I can see straight through if I'm doing something that's just designed to make my boss look good to their boss. What I get a kick out of in my current role though is helping people understand what's going on when I present data, and teaching them the ins and outs of products and systems. I have always had a fascination with language, syntax, semantics, acquisition, foreign languages, you name it. I wasn't an amazing biology student, but I wasn't bad at it by any means. I loved psychology in high school though and was pretty good at that.I'm borderline an INTP and INFP, though if you asked those around me, most would lean towards the former.I'm afraid that I'm romanticising the notion of what it would be like to be an SLP. And I genuinely am afraid that I'm thinking that the grass is greener. Though I can say that this isn't a new thought for me. I've had SLP at the back of my mind for the past 3-4 years when I first heard of it. I'm a pretty introverted person, and while I don't think I can say that I'm outright awful with children, it does take me a while to strike a rapport with them. But I guess that's the same with me and people in general. I don't mind report writing, as long as it doesn't get in the way of time spent actually helping people. So right now I think that even though I like the idea of it, the reality of it may turn me off once I get into any kind of placement. I'm just afraid that I won't be very good at the caring side an SLP has to be mindful of. Also, I'm a guy, though I don't think this should matter all that much.
l0zavz	1611108716	280	I'm currently working in a toxic work environment (very high turnover and burnout) working 10-12 hour days full-time ($78k). It's very emotionally taxing work (working with trauma &amp; very unsafe suicidal/homicidal teens), and unfortunately upper management has managed the COVID pandemic very poorly - leaving to a COVID outbreak and further burnout/quitting of even their most seasoned staff. So- I've reached my limit, and have full compassion fatigue and burnout now unfortunately.In the meantime - I have been given an offer to relocate to a new (highly reputable) company in 2-3 months making significantly more ($102k) with much better work life balance. I'm seriously considering taking the offer, but trying to figure out how to survive until then.My therapist/psychologist highly recommended quitting my current job due to it being toxic and negatively impacting my mental health, and focus on healing between now and the time of the new job. Another option was to take a leave of absence for a couple weeks to heal, and then return &amp; put in notice for a month later. My boss today mentioned that I could possibly take leave of absence -though I need to figure things out first for a week or 2 before taking it.&amp;#x200B;Do you recommend putting in notice now? Or taking leave of absence now so I can gain some sanity before returning? I'm at my wits end, honestly. I don't have enough PTO (because the accrual rate is minuscule) to even take a week off, and my PTO today has been bombardment of emails and calls. Help! What's a good decision mentally &amp; professionally? (and no - I do not need them for reference letters at all in the future).
l0wqj3	1611100552	121	I’ve been at my current job for about a year and a half, and it’s... nice. The company is AMAZING! Super understanding of mental health, which is a huge thing for me, but my position is very emotionally taxing. I’ve tried to branch into other positions within the company, but I keep getting rejected with not a whole lot of feedback (if anyone can help with the STAR method, I’d love that). I’m reaching the end of my rope with it, which is intense burnout, but I’m not sure if I should quit, or continue to look for other positions within, or if it’s just burnout talking and I need to take a long vacation. Any advice would be great! Thank you!
kyr4sa	1610830260	634	Hi everyone- first time poster here. I would appreciate any replies at all because I truly feel like I’m stuck in a rut here. I recently graduated 6 months back (International Business). I was all excited to get out in the new world and experience what it was like to apply all of the stuff I learnt at the workplace. I was hellbent on going down the business consultant lane as that was the only thing that really appealed to me (the research, the analytical aspects etc- I am a very analytical person and always have an eye for details, I really enjoy it). I landed an offer @ a leading consultancy. It seemed like a dream come true at first...I quickly learnt it was not for me.The hours were ungodly (as all consultant jobs are), and I was unable to manage the workload amidst personal issues (both family and mental) + having to contribute greatly to a single parent household. It was a WFH job and I quickly became fed up with sitting at a computer for 12-14 hours a day. The seniors kept dumping work on me and I couldn’t deal with it. It was a lot of pressure for being a tiny cog. I never got credit for my work. I know this is the way it is for interns and I may sound whiny but this is what I felt. So I ended up leaving. I feel like my degree has gone down the drain... completely. My parent decided it was a good idea to give me work experience at their firm - a film company/SME. I had already worked with the parent for a couple of years. I wrote and directed a lot of films. It got me thinking- this was something I wanted to do. Not like a hobby, but full time. It was just something that thrilled me so much- even if I had to deal with occasional burnout. The difference between working here and working there was I could take the pressure because I enjoyed it anyway. Well it was going well for a while- until I realized I wasn’t getting credit where it was due here either- for a lot of the projects we’ve done (about 8-9). Saying this makes me feel like I’m awfully whiny, but I didn’t get credit for the work I put in- and I put in a lot of it e.g. if I directed the entire thing, I’d be credited as “co director” despite being promised I wouldn’t be. I quickly got upset over this too, and now after speaking to a countless number of people, I’ve decided that the best decision is to leave.But what am I supposed to do? At least I was able to direct and write with the resources my parent’s company had. It’s pretty much impossible to start anew without anything at all- or is it? I don’t know. Should I go back to consultancy? As per my knowledge that industry isn’t going to change anytime soon. It’s going to be tiring and there is no work life balance. Or, should I vouch for something else? I’m awfully confused at this point because other jobs like marketing and HR don’t appeal to me- at least not in the same way consulting does. I’d really love- and appreciate- some  advice about how to go about this. I’ll have to think of something quick because I really don’t want to be sitting in my parent’s money either.I just feel like asking for a job that I will enjoy and make money out of + work life balance is too much to ask at this point. And aren’t jobs to be boring anyway? I’ve always heard people say if it was fun you’d have to pay for it.
kw8nxw	1610511073	261	My job has always been crazy (high-stress, little control, long hours) but it got way worse during the pandemic. Our department today is half the size that it was in February due to layoffs and unreplaced attrition, but our workload is not that different. I've pushed through and basically have worked 55+ hour weeks since March. I'm 100% remote and feel increasingly disconnected. I had reservations about my job pre-pandemic but I was feeling pretty burnt out by last month. I had a few days off at the end of the year and thought I'd come back refreshed, but I still feel burnt to a crisp. I spend half my day staring at my computer in a fugue state. I can't focus, I forget to reply to emails or to show up to meetings, I make mistakes, and I really struggle to tackle anything complicated or time-consuming. I don't think anyone has noticed yet but I'm usually the most organized, responsive, self-motivated person on my team so it's only a matter of time. I'm frustrated with myself and worried that going on like this is bad for me professionally and for my mental health. I have a ton of weeks of sick and vacation built up. Is it crazy to ask my employer if I can take 2 weeks of my sick time (not vacation) for mental health? Is there anything I can do to get my groove back? I'm eventually planning to change careers but I don't think it'll be feasible to move forward with that until the economy is better.

kw3gij	1610493638	997	It's 23:30 PM right now. I have to get up at 6 AM in the morning for work. I've been lying in my bed restlessly for the past 4 hours trying to sleep but instead contemplating on whether I did make the right choice or not. Because if I didn't, I sure am in a rush to fix it. I really need some second thoughts on this.  **The Dilemma**  I'll make it as short and readable as possible:Got hired as a meeting scheduler in a billion $ insurance company in November. Had very very impressive numbers and as result, I was offered a promotion after just 3 months (after New Year).  I was offered 2 different promotions. I'll write a short description of each respective choice:  **1) Insurance Advisor**  \- The role just beneath an insurance agent. Whilst an agent sells physically, the advisor sells only through the phone. My current job is scheduling meetings for the agents to sell on.\- This job would entail me moving floors to a new department and getting a new boss.  I will also get a formal education at the Insurance Academy that will allow me to get the skills necessary to sell the insurances. Later on, I would be able to become an insurance agent.  **2) Sales Coach**  \- A customizable role where I'll be scheduling meetings 50% of the time and coaching/training colleagues the other 50%. I'll have a focus specifically on employee development and helping them reach their target goals.\- I'll be staying in the telemarketing department working with my current boss.  I will also receive formal training in whatever is needed for me to do the job: communication, sales, management, coaching e.t.c.  **Thoughts on the promotion**  My first thoughts were that I would eventually burn out in sales (selling insurances on the phone), and that it wouldn't differ much from scheduling sales meetings. I am damn good at it, but it doesn't really give me enough challenge to satisfy me. It's too familiar. I have however only been in tele sales so far. (for +2 years).I leaned much more towards the coaching role since it'd be something I haven't done a lot but still consider my area of expertise (telesales). It'd be different works tasks, but then again, would I really?  **The choice I made**  After a quick chat with each of my potential bosses, I decided to go with my initial gut feeling of being scared of a sales-burnout, hence I decided to say yes to the coaching part. That would also allow me to get quite a bit off the phone myself (50%/50%)  However, when I asked the telesales-boss what the next step on the ladder would be after coach, she answered that it was her job. Hence there was a limitation on further advancement as of now - but nobody knows what would happen in the future. This was yesterday. This morning at work, I decided to officially decline the insurance advisor job, and hence my decision was final. (I believe I can however still change it if I go first thing in the morning)  **The Situation**  I went home today after work and had a chat with my beloved mother, asking for advice. She voiced some concerns about the coaching job not being really different from what I was already doing. Before I got the job, I had sworn to myself that I wanted to get off the phone as fast as possible.She also pointed out, that it'd perhaps be a dead end and I'd be stuck in telemarketing for the next few years at least, maybe not full time on the phone, but still kind of in the same job. Got a little mad since I felt like she didn't understand me, but ...Now I've been laying, thinking, pondering and I am beginning to doubt myself, because she may be partly right. Is it really better to go all-in on the sales part of the job and keep working at what I am good at to advance my career this way? I'll eventually get off selling on the phone and make big money.The other option is staying in a coaching job for the next year and pushing to get a leader/management position and advancing that way. There isn't really a paved way for this specifically like with the sales agent way, so it's something of a bet to just count on me advancing as fast as I possibly might want to within management. I don't even know if I like management since I haven't tried it yet.. or ever.  **The salary**  Salary isn't really a big factor for me. Or so I like to tell myself, but with all this pondering and wondering, maybe salary does play a factor as well? I live in Scandinavia btw, hence the high salary.**Current Salary**  $3450/month**Coach Salary**  $4100/month **Insurance Advisor Salary**  $4400/month + $1600/month in possible commissionsAnd for future reference:  **Insurance Agent**  $5000 to +$15000 (depending on how good I become).  &amp;#x200B;So how do I weigh my options? Do I base it on how much I can challenge myself? Future possibilities? Best salary? What I think I can do the longest without being bored? What I am best at currently?  I am a fucking mess right now. I need to go in first thing in the morning and change my decision if I need to have any influence on things before they start setting anything in motion.   What are your opinions? I'll throw so much fucking love your way if you can help me manage this tricky situation because I am really lost about what to do and which direction to go with my career right now.   I'll be on here responding to whatever questions may arise.  In advance,  THANK YOU!     &lt;3

ku73y3	1610251924	523	Good evening everyone.I'm Zyad, an Egyptian 24 year old who's blessed enough to grow up in a middle class family with a relatively okay education &amp; healthcare in the gulf. Everything was good, my life was going alright, i was a very talented artist as a kid amongst my peers, very cheerful &amp; motivated. At 17 y.o I got into one of the greatest architecture colleges in the middle east (scholarship), and i was doing exceptionally well. Art, goofy drawings, animation, competitive video games were my passion, but they had to remain a side thing because arab parents are super conservative.Towards my age of 21, things went downhill rapidly. My father lost his job, we lost a chunk of our lifetime savings, i failed semester after semester, i fell into depression, lost a lot of weight &amp; became super frail, i tried to change majors to pursue multimedia &amp; art but my father kicked me out of the apartment for a day after a heated physical argument, got myself into twitch streaming in 2018 to clear my mind, but then we lost our residency in this gulf country, and we had to move out to our country of origin, Egypt, essentially restarting 4.5 years worth of university progress all over again, in a 3rd world country where basic human rights + needs are considered a luxury.24 years old, forced to go through architecture allover again, in a country i never lived in before, met with more failure &amp; a lot of closed doors, literally &amp; metaphorically, i finally, after 2 years of no internet at home, got the means to actually twitch stream again.3 months ago i started to stream again. That "go live" button was my fucking prozac, a digital one. Twitch pumped life, joy, &amp; hope back into me. That hope that i can still manage to do what i love to do, which is create, design, draw, color, film, and most importantly, compete in a game. Streaming gave me that hope that i can still make a dent in this world (so fucking cliche i know), and that i can still have something to work towards. I see myself in the next 2 years as the biggest streamer in the middle east, and i will make an impact, pushing through every electrical power outage, every internet throttle, every forced university assignment, every laptop blues-creen &amp; CPU burnout, and every mental battle.In less than 2 months, i have grew a significant amount, at an alarming rate, you can search zyad1996 on twitch tracker. With the help of some of the most beautiful people online, from 1 viewer to 6 average views peaking at 12. From 5 followers to 115 followers, and 209 hours streamed 1300 hours watched.I sit here in my bed, as i'm shaking off this mosquito, and wonder if this is all just me daydreaming/fantasizing, or is it a feasible/realistic outcome. The outcome of becoming the biggest baddest streamer in the middle east. I would love to read your comments if you have read this far. Good mental health is super fucking important, as well as mosquito zappers.Zyad1996 on twitch.
krvrf1	1609962895	167	My time in university has been full of ups and downs because I am prone to severe anxiety and depression. I am going towards MSc.Right now I am close to burning bridges because I have been neglecting communicating with my supervisors. I have been working on my thesis for a year so far and feel like I am completely stuck.I do not know if I can work in this field if I am already burnt out? This career direction is something that interests me a lot. But do I fit there?What things have you all valued when you were deciding on your (science related) careers? I know this field can bring me good income but actually getting a job feels like a really distant thing.I know this message has been kind of rambling and I apologize for that. However it would be really helpful to hear from you guys and maybe get tips how to survive in the science world these days. Thank you a lot in advance!

krl6vr	1609928289	373	Tldr : either coming up with proposal of department change maybe in few months or coming up with my undervalue payment and ask for good payraise. (Second tldr at bottom*)So im really really burnout atm, dont know if it because my current work is so passive (im very an active person when it comes to a job) Like i need to handle a project or something (im head video editor now and everyday mostly i spent time staring at my screen)Feels so useless l, never included in meeting never really got into production only sitting there and being thrown job to do.I ask for include me in meeting and they of course said we will, but always forgot and its a zoom meeting so i cant just join knowing when they will have a meeting as they share the link in their own groupsI can mostly get a payraise if i bring about this up, but deep inside my heart i want something different, i want to be active, i want included in meeting, setting up a project, calling people, etcNow im very competitive person, thats why i always need to be standout among the others. So changing career will most likely slowly getting me to attention with the others, because when we did our work which is video editing it feels super shady, you get praise when make a great video but then its only once every 3 month when we have big project and when nothing big ? We're just bunch of people staring at screen with no fun, joy at all.So either i can feel standout with having maybe say higher paycheck than the others or should i just slowly standout by asking change department which i dont know when it will happen.As for back up, im starting to line up a job now and yes im pretty much on safe spot if they cant give me what i want. (Pretty sh*t company tbh) So the point is, im sick of editing and feel useless but i can get big pay raise if i stay which may affect the quality of my work because i hate doing it.Or i ask for change but if they refuse it, ill just quit ?

kpxz63	1609723677	404	I'm feeling scared... I just turned 30 and I'm at the crossroads here...​Ive been doing music production / songwriting full time in my country for several years and prior to that, i made music passionately as a hobby..However, i feel I'm losing my interest in it and it's scary! It's been this way for a year i'd say. Right now I dont look forward going to work, i dont feel inspired listening to music, my accomplishments dont feel like much and even though i'm pretty succesful, i'm also a bit indifferent.I get small bouts now and then when i feel "man i miss making music, what was i thinking?" but then that goes away.I have no idea whether it's because i dont genuinely enjoy doing music production / songwriting at all anymore (or at least working full time), whether it's me being depressed or stressed out / anxious about something, maybe im going in the wrong direction within my field, or maybe i just want to do something else entirely.All i know is, i want to be on vacation as long as i can at the moment to avoid going back to work..I've looked into alternative fields like Programming or Software Development. It seems moderately interesting, the demand for it is big at least in my country, i know some basics in it and i have some ideas i could actualise if only i could program stuff properly.Plus, I can always produce music in my spare time or combine music production with game developing ex. making game music or audio plugins.And also, at this age, i'm starting to think about a stable job more so that i can slowly start to entertain the idea of a partner / family and so on... something i cannot do in the music field. As long as it's at least an "ok" job, i think i'm going to be satisfied.​So right now the 3 things i question are:​Am i depressed in general? Should i resume my SSRI meds &amp; therapy?Am i anxious about something thus my brain is shutting down? Maybe i've been at the verge of a burnout?Am i in the right field after all? Should i re-educate myself to become something else ex. Programmer?​What are your initial thoughts? I'm afraid i will make the wrong choice and it's now or never i have to choose whether i want to continue or change fields?​Any advice is appreciated. THX!!
kn5qjs	1609346949	102	I'm considering a career change from engineer to vet tech. Has anyone made this leap? I've been an engineer for almost 10 years and I'm honestly just bored of the profession and have slowly lost any passion - the pandemic has made this strikingly more obvious. I've always had a passion and love for animals so am considering retraining as a vet tech in Canada. I'm scared (?) Of two things: (1) the pay cut (2) I'm reading a lot about vet tech burnout.  Looking for honest options from those that have made a similar change where it's gone good or bad.
km1vww	1609198519	116	Any advice on the jobs prospects between the 2 fields for the next 10-20 years? I am debating med school vs a career in IT/ Cybersecurity. I have a passion for both medical sciences &amp; technology. The thing about medicine that worries me is work-life balance, burnout, etc. The thing about IT that worries me is lack of job security, especially as I get older. Physicians can practice for decades (while staying up to date on latest practices &amp; research). But people in tech can get left behind &amp; replaced by young, hungry candidates who are more up to date &amp; willing to work for cheap. Any advice, especially from those in either field is much appreciated.
klsszt	1609170391	267	I was recently promoted to a top position in my company, a position that a lot of people would like to have.  Basically, I manage the division and report to corporate headquarters.  The performance of the division falls under my shoulder.  After a few months, I realize now that this may not be for me and I cannot see myself in this role long term.The stress and anxiety of the added responsibility and the need to be constantly “on” is now weighing on me and I am afraid that eventually it will lead to burnout or either physical or mental breakdown.  I also feel that I am not the right fit for the role based on my personality and skills.  I’m good at a lot of things but not on what I think the company needs right now. Not sure what to do at this stage.  I can ride it out and see how far I can go…  Or I can ask for my previous job but this would come with a lot of issues and not sure how to go about doing this.  Firstly, disappointment and embarrassment for those that vouched for me to get the promotion.  Also, the view that I couldn’t hack it within the company.  The latter I’m not really concerned about as you do you, but the former is more concerning.   Even though the financial benefit will be a lot higher, I think I am willing to forego it for less stress and peace in my life.   Any advice?
klp1cn	1609155715	542	Hi there, not sure if this topic is relevant to this sub but I guess I'll give it a try! Feel free to redirect me somewhere else if I'm wrong. I am a 32yo woman, been working in the wine business for 10+ years now. At first I was working as a waitress/sommelier during college and while taking all my wine diplomas, then stepped up a bit with winery hospitality and lately as a sales and hospitality manager for a big name in the industry. So I've been under pressure for my whole career (being a student while working full time) and I don't think I got burned out because of the workload (although it could have been building up over the years, plus I'm in a different phase of my life than 10 years ago). Now, the two wineries I worked at were really toxic environments, filled with desperate workaholics who would happily work 20hrs a week of unpaid overtime on a regular basis, and several other issues (but I don't want to turn this post into a rant, let's just say that my family and friends were shocked anytime I would vent about the situation so I'm not exaggerating). Due to the current world situation, I've been furloughed at the beginning of October. My burnout was so bad that I was seriously relieved when I was told that I was losing my job. So even though they could take me back next spring, I don't want to go back there at all. The problem is that I can't bring myself to look for a new job. Anytime I'm browsing the job offers (or at least the few that I can find at the moment, with every business shut down) I feel like a child who is stomping their feet and yelling "I don't want to!". Same goes for online courses and stuff, I tried to find something useful to do during this break but I feel overwhelmed and can't bring myself to invest more money and effort in my education in a field that I'm not so sure I want to keep working in (and I don't know what else to do since anything else would be a blank slate). Even worse, I am annoyed by the whole wine business to the point that if I see a wine related post while scrolling social media, I feel really bothered by it. I didn't even drink one single bottle of wine during the whole lockdown thing because I can't enjoy it anymore! But this is what I have been doing for my whole life, I'm highly specialized and I have no other spendable skills, plus I feel like my discomfort is caused by these two toxic work experiences and there must be a way to get around it before forcing myself to a drastic change.  So, considering that I've been sitting on my ass for almost 3 months now, I would say that I had the chance to get some rest, I have been home with my husband, resuming all the old hobbies that I was forced to leave behind because I didn't have time/energy. But still, this is not getting better. How do I address and begin to fix this?
kia3th	1608659044	142	First off, I like both careers. My goals are to have a good work life balance and invest in real estate. I’m just confused because I like coding and critical thinking, but I also am interested in medicine. I’m worried about debt, malpractice, and burnout in medicine, and I’m worried about saturation, micromanagement, and ageism in the tech industry. For being a doctor, I’m not looking into surgery and am interested into specialities like gynecology and emergency medicine. For tech, I’m interested in working for companies like Uber and Lyft and probably FAANG companies outside Silicon Valley (I’m looking to live in cheaper cities and away from California cities and NYC, maybe even Seattle). Also, I’m doing well in high school, as I’m an A student taking mostly college credits with good test scores. I also love learning, so what are your thoughts?
kf64am	1608238720	195	Hi everyone, I’m a young professional (24F) at a political firm (a private company, NOT nonprofit/government) where I work on online fundraising on behalf of candidates/organizations. My firm is based in DC, I am working remotely out of state, and will still be post-COVID.I got into this role because I love politics, but my current firm has caused me a bit of burnout after this past campaign cycle. For that reason I have been casually interviewing at a couple other firms that do what we do, as well as some similar agencies. I have an offer at one firm, but did not move forward with the interview process add another firm. My current company has treated me quite well, so I’m not totally sure I want to leave, but I’m wondering how to use these offers/interest to my advantage to ask for either a pay raise or some work flexibility (eg, condensed workweek, changing my start time, etc.)I have never been in this position before as this is my first full time job post-undergrad and would love any advice for how to start a conversation with my boss about this or other advice. Thanks so much!
kclmex	1607902671	85	I have a bachelors degree in business administration with a concentration in finance, experience running my family’s small business (because I’m burnout and depressed so I’m not ready to enter the workforce just yet).Got accepted into two MSc programs, one in data analytics the other one in business analytics because I want to transition into data science. However, I was told these degrees are worthless. Am I shooting myself in the foot again? What degree should I pursue to be able to reach a 6-figure salary?
kbkk41	1607755727	318	I'm on a gap year at the moment, and frankly have no idea what to pursue career-wise; I'm hoping you guys can be of some help! For some context, I'm 18M, going to a small liberal arts college next fall, and am open to studying/pursuing pretty much any subject.  I've got a few years of experience under my belt, and some (fairly lofty) desires for my career, in order of importance:**Wants:*** I want to do something meaningful. This could mean helping people, exploring the world, solving challenging problems, etc. The thought of spending 50 years behind a desk making someone else money and nothing else is depressing to me.* I want to be intellectually stimulated a lot; I'm not picky in that sense. If a job forces me to think a lot, I'm all in.* Money-wise, I only want enough to live a comfortable, middle/upper middle-class lifestyle in a large city (NYC, for example); 70-100k is sufficient. The more the merrier, of course, but that's all I need.* If possible, I'd love to work outside and/or travel for part of the day/year.**Experience:*** I have a ton of experience in geoscience (2 years' teaching experience, a university research position in geochemistry, and a ton of background knowledge) but I think I'm probably going through some kind of burnout. I'm not necessarily ruling out careers in geology, but it'll take a while before I sort out my feelings towards the subject.* I have good experience in management, specifically nonprofit management; right now, I'm a program coordinator at a small education cooperative, and was a co-founder for a sizable (now defunct) environmental organization. I'm also an Eagle Scout with experience leading my Troop if that helps. * I have some experience working menial, unskilled work (mailroom/warehouse jobs) but I doubt that'll be relevant.That's all I've got! I'm open to pretty much anything at this point, so fire away. Thanks for reading.
kb6xqs	1607707084	138	I live in Canada, and have been dealing with depression and severe burnout since 2018.Because of this, I moved back to my home country (in South America) and have been running my family’s small business so that I could have more flexibility and autonomy (I have a bachelors degree in business and finance). However, it’s time for me to progress my career and find a “real” job. I’m dreading going back to Canada and work long hours with little benefits (e.g only two week vacations per year), so I’ve been thinking of pursuing a masters in data analytics in Europe and relocating there, since it seems to offer better work life balance. Anybody who lives in Europe (specially Ireland or Scotland) could confirm if the above is true and it would be a sound move for me to do?
kaw4fr	1607662566	190	Hey. I'm a 27 y/o M currently residing in Oregon, Recently moved from California. I graduated from uni with a B.S. in Geology (2.9) in 2015. I worked in outdoor education from 2015-2018. I left that industry because it's very seasonal and less stable (pandemic broke a lot of non-profits) and transitioned to healthcare. Easiest entry was EMT, so I did that for a year and now I'm working as a Medical Assistant. Planning on staying with my company for a while and they have scheduled pay raises so I'll be making $20/hr in the future.&amp;#x200B;I like Public Health, esp health promotion, health education, and emergency preparedness and fear being a burnout 50 y/o cringing at patients. My inherent laziness and frugality put up big red flags when thinking of a Masters so I'm applying for a Graduate Certificate of Public Health right now. It's the core classes of a MPH and much more affordable. All my applications will be complete by the end of the month (not priority deadline, w/e). I've heard mixed reviews about my grand plan.  Anybody care to share their success story? Or warn me otherwise?
k96caq	1607441804	106	Making a change from marketing/sales to journalismSo I’ve been miserable in sales for a while now and have been thinking about making a change to some kind of investigative journalism or reporting. I’ve always liked writing and love research, working with people, and the variety that working on a new story each time would offer as I tend to burnout (even from jobs I’d initially like) from boredom after a while. Has anyone ever made a change like this or know someone who has? I’m wondering if going back to school is necessary, I’m already a proficient writer and honestly feel ripped off from my marketing degree.
k87rs7	1607308416	174	Background: I'm a mechanical engineer(28M) working in the oil and gas manufacturing industry. I took my current job around 2 years ago and it is a different state away from my friends and family. I thought I would meet new people and make friends but it has not panned out well. Also, Covid has not helped. I have been feeling extremely burnout out as the year comes to a close. My family and a couple of my friends live in Dallas but I fear that the job opportunities for mechanical engineers are low in DFW. Issue : 1. Burnout.2. Away from family and friends. 3. Feels like my current job might not have much of a future.Plan : 1. I'm thinking about moving to DFW or maybe Austin.2. Transitioning into a different career: automation or  sales engineer 3. Get an MBA 4. Get the CAPM cert (already taken the course)Wanted Results :1. Have close friends and family, and start putting roots down.2. Transition into a career that better suits me, and has a future.
k7zuj0	1607281719	243	 I was lucky enough to get my dream job in the entertainment industry right out of college 2019, but then the pandemic hit and the changes to our team  turned it into a nightmare. In a single day my pay got cut to $18/hr, my department was gutted to a quarter of its size. I'm now stuck working 11 hours a day 5-6 days a week trying to cover the work of three people, and based on my last performance review, I'm not doing it well. I can't take off my mask in the building, I can't interact with my co workers face to face, I have to take my 15 minute lunch break in the car for god sake since , and being told during all this that I'm underperforming just gutted me and I decided to look into leaving my postion. Well as it turns out in my amended contact there was a new non compete that would keep me from working with any company I regularly interact with for two years. These hours aren't sustainable long term for my mental or physical health, but leaving the company would end my career in the entertainment industry, and coasting on my savings during a global recession probably isn't the smartest idea. I'm sure there's other people stuck like this, how are you all coping? Has anyone managed to get out of a contract this befor and continue working in their field?
k7lqch	1607224112	361	tl;Just started this job on December. My job scope was to build pc for clients. But, since is my first job, I told my boss that I wanted to learn as much as possible especially on the managerial perspective, i.e sales strategies, interacting with clients, marketing / promotion. But when the 3 month probation period started, on my first week I started to realised that I wouldn't be able to explore any of it. Not only that, my task also consist of many hard manual labor and repetitive of the same building over and over again day by day which I'm almost mastering it and over about it. I'm also having issues synergizing with many of the staff because many aren't having the managerial level mindset and are working just to work except for one senior of mine which he has plans on expanding the company. I was given a 3 month probation first without contract. So I was wondering should I leave and find a new place, or just pull through the probation and only start finding for a new one to prevent burning and bridges. I'm starting to burnout and demotivated in working especially since I prefer working on a desk job and at least 5 days a week.Only pros I can think of is being close to my house which is a 10min drive and having a very relaxed working enviroment. But I personally wanted a more balanced work life type of job which may sound entitled, but would nice to have. tl;dr  1) Couldn't get along with other colleagues.2) bored of my same hard labor work everyday.3)Learning more towards building pc but doesn't really improve my career goals of managering / strategizing.4)6 days a week job, my work life balance is close to non existence since I get too exhausted by the end of the day from just doing hard manual labor. Should I leave since no contract? or stay throughout 3 months and only start finding a new job? I'm still pretty lost in my career path since I'm planning to move away from my studies as a game dev. Would like some opinions about it.
k6mjup	1607094383	333	My job has had an inconsistent workload the past few months, even more so than usual due to covid.  I'm required to physically be at my workplace even though I could have the type of job role that I could do from home ...but that's not really possible at this specific business since the rest of my co-workers need to physically be on location (and as a result, they need me on location with them ...even on the slow days). Trying to stay vague for anonymity. This past year though has made me realize how much more I would enjoy a career with WFH options and flexibility. And how much more I just want to work to live rather than live to work. Back to my main point, how do I find the time and energy outside of my current job to make this actually happen when I'm already burnt out? And to have time for my personal goals, hobbies, and relationships? While my job isn't all bad (and I'm thankful to have it), I can't keep going the way I am.I feel like I come home as a zombie and only give a fraction of myself to the people and activities that are most important to me in life. I know at some level the answer might just be to power through and do it, but even that adds more to my feelings of burnout. I took a mini staycation back in the fall in an attempt to help the situation, and the relief I felt from that was short-lived. The time wasn't enough to truly rest, spend time with my family, and then also work on my personal goals. Part of me wishes I could just take a month off to chill out and figure out next steps, but that doesn't seem possible.Thanks for reading! Hoping that others who have been in a similar position may have some advice or suggestions ...or at least be able to commiserate with me lol.
k5f995	1606934240	187	Hi yall,I was looking around for a good thread but can't find any so let's try this one. I just wanted to hear your stories on how you've fared in this pandemic, particularly for this to be a safe space for your negative thoughts and emotions, as with mine.I'll start with my story. So I got a new job during the pandemic, while changing careers. It started out nice but ~3 months after, I just feel so empty. I mostly feel that I'm doing the job alone, learning so many new things by myself and without a sense of direction and appreciation of the projects I'm doing. I wanted to shift to this career for quite a while and I still like what I'm learning but I'm finding less and less motivation to my job now.I do have a nice manager and the company is not too bad. But having almost zero interaction with everyone just feels lonely. I don't want to blame the management or the company as this pandemic has all left us unprepared but I honestly feel like I have one foot out the door.

k557gg	1606896187	421	I currently work as an ER Nurse, graduated 2019. I mainly got into the profession because of family influence and job stability (a fall back for Med School). After going through the program and learning about healthcare, I have learned it is not for me. I mean this in the sense of workload, expectations, pay (not very good in Canada for a new nurse regardless of skillset), etc. Healthcare can be very fulfilling and also regretful at the same time. Every single senior/seasoned staff member I ever spoke to would regret working in the field and wished they did something else, but cannot leave because they are too far in and have a family to care for. Burnout is real and I worry for my work/life balance in the future.My end goal is to be able to work in a setting that does not put my life at risk, earn enough money to buy a house, and make a positive difference in the world that helps multiple people at a time, and work with like-minded individuals.My grades and interests in math were better than my science, and I have always wanted to work in an office setting. For the last year or so, I have tried to learn how to program on my own through free courses, videos, and books. I love the idea of creating and manipulating data the way I want it and have it execute the way it's planned (unlike telling humans what to do, with uncontrollable factors). Currently I am enrolled in some data science courses to obtain a certificate, hoping to be able to have formal learning to add to my resume. However, I do not know how I could apply it in terms of jobs and real life scenerios. I have researched nursing/health informatics and their masters programs, but there is no clear path for me to follow because it is a growing field. Is there anyone in a similar situation, or can guide me as I am lost?I am very open to any guidance or feedback, and I would greatly appreciated it! I will also answer any questions if my post is not clear enough. I apologize if it sounds like a rant, I meant for the post to explain my thoughts/understanding of my situation.TLDR; I am a Registered Nurse and I don't see a bright future for the profession in Canada (especially during this pandemic), is there any way I can transition out without having to go back to school for 4 years realistically?
k4mjlj	1606835141	321	 Hi All!I am pretty burnt out at my current job; I enjoy the company and the people but just sick of my daily work. I am super excited to take a leap and start doing a coding boot camp in early 2021, just starting some pre-work now before officially starting!! There was a lot of build-up to this, mostly internal reflection and external job research (calls/interviews/etc.); I was planning on giving notice sometime in Dec (possibly this week due to some odd circumstances at the school) for an official end date mid to end of January (if they will have me that long after giving notice)**Issue Context**In the past 4/5 months, I have been regularly chatting with my Manager about how I feel overworked/stretched and find the lack of clarity/role expectations made it hard for me. For the most part, my manager has been engaged, but not much has changed (things were supposed to get off my plate but it just didn't happen, backfilling resources who left due to burnout never came, and other similar things). Well, I was hoping to get through part of January in this role, but now my manager is saying she is concerned with my performance. Frankly, I agree; I haven't been in a good mental state for quite some time and really don't like my work at all.**Questions*** I want to leave on a good note (I really hope to work here again someday)     * Is giving notice shortly after receiving negative feedback, essentially the final nail in the coffin for this company and me professionally?   * Is there a tactful way of doing this without being a total AH? (Concern of coming off as I have been slacking because I planned on leaving when in reality it's for mental health)* Is there a good way to give notice this far out when you have a 'mark' on you?
k3z5rc	1606753772	337	Typically, when I hear someone discuss feeling burnt out, it's because they are overworked and have too much to do at their job. That's not really the source of my burnout. While I do have occasional days where I have a substantial workload, lately they have been infrequent. I have gotten to a point where I actually crave those days, because at least I'll have work to do to pass the time more quickly. I want to feel useful and productive in my job. And lately, I just don't. I sit in my office and try to come up with work for myself while watching the time pass painfully slow.I will also usually go around and check in with my manager and co-workers that I often work with on projects and ask if there's anything I can help them with, and more than half the time, they just say no or maybe later.Overall, this is a "safe" job, and I am thankful to have it during these uncertain times. For the immediate future, it is what I need. But beyond that, I don't really have a future here. I'm just here for the paycheck these days. The pay is good, but I have no other benefits and no room to ever "move up" as it is a small business. I guess that weighs in the back of my mind and adds to my feeling of burnout. This was always meant to be a 2ish year stepping stone to build experience/savings until I could move on to something better with benefits and flexibility, but right now, I just feel stuck with no end in sight.I keep trying to remind myself that it could always be worse and to just be thankful and hang in there until I can move on to something else.I guess what I'm ultimately wondering is how else can I move past my boredom burnout? What are good ways to "cope"? Has anyone else ever felt like this? If do, what did you do?Thanks for reading!
jz7ygk	1606094504	196	Hi! I’m a 26 year old female. I have a Master’s in Mental Health counseling (graduated 2019) and worked as a counselor for a year. I decided to leave the field due to burnout and essentially figuring out that this just isnt the right career path for me. I’ve been thinking about getting into HR as I believe I have many transferrable skills. It doesn’t seem too easy to break into HR, though. All of my jobs have been in the mental health field, so I don’t have any other experience which has really pigeon holed me. I’m looking into basic receptionist jobs with the thinking that I could potentially work my way up into an administrative assistant/office manager type role, which could then allow me to be more marketable for a HR role. Is this a good way to break into HR? I also looked into recruitment/talent acquisition as a way to work my way into HR, but I’m not really sure if it’s a good match for me. I’m a very laid back, reserved person. I’m not a sales/business person at all and I get the sense that people in these roles are. Thoughts? Thanks!
jxdhuk	1605827208	328	I was a bartender/barback for six years until I got COVID in November 2019 (didn't know it was COVID, looking back it DEFinitely was.) I was deathly ill, ended up hospitalized in February.  I essentially learned that I can't do a physical labor job anymore, due to a underlying health condition. I worked at Target very briefly stocking grocery until COVID hit mainstream, and I've been on unemployment since.I sustained a TBI in December 2016 that gave me PNES, and a chronic neck/back injury. It was hard to stay employed in the service industry with this injury, because overwork would lead to seizures. I had to drop out of college twice for that same condition.I have been seizure free for three months due to being on unemployment. I am starting to lose my marbles, having nothing to do. My brain feels slower than it was when I was seizing, I'm incredibly depressed. I figure I should probably be trying to build my future since I have the time.I really enjoyed working in service: the fast pace kept my brain sharp, I got a ton of social interaction, and a paid workout every shift. I liked the comradery with my coworkers, and how diverse they were. That being said, while physical labor is out of the question, I cannot stand desk jobs.  It would be ideal to have a gig that gave me the same benefits as above without the easy burnout.I am in a ton of debt from the medical bills and my college fails. I can't afford to go back to school. My hope is to potentially learn a trade or get trained-in for a new career. My main interests are in psychology, traditional medicine, massage therapy, philosophy, (farm?) animal care/training, PCA-like assistance (cooking and cleaning for others, can't do the heavy lifting), advocacy, counseling.Any advice on where to go from here?  What career paths are out there?  I'm really scared for my future.
jvqxt2	1605609825	427	After high school, I took a few months to just work and decide on what I wanted to major in. I ended up going to a community college with plans to go into nursing since I come from a family of nurses; however, I'm absolutely terrible at science and math, so I'd end up failing, dropping, or withdrawing the courses, so I gave up on that. I then switched to education, but I ended up getting a job at a daycare/my uncle's girlfriend is a teacher and after a bit, I decided it wasn't the path for me as I found it very stressful when working with pre-school and kindergarten kids as my personality just didn't fit and I had a hard time getting them to listen to me. I then went into a short dental assisting program and have a certificate from it, and even though everyone told me to, I never bothered looking for jobs or taking the X-ray exam because although I'd be making way more than I do right now, I wasn't very passionate about it. My therapist said that human services would be a good career path for me to eventually become a therapist myself, and I was excited about it, but then when I researched it more I saw how much school there is to make a decent living and there's a lot of burnout. Plus, my boyfriend said I should do something that makes money right out of school, so I decided not to.  I just feel very behind and lost at this moment lol.I know that most of the majors I look into are ones dealing with kids and/or mental health. I think another thing that keeps me back is my own mental health, I have really bad social anxiety, so every major I'm interested in I end up doubting my ability to do it. I still work at the daycare and I talk to the kids a lot, and am a bit less anxious than when I started 2 years ago, but I still have trouble casually talking to my coworkers unless it's about a kid. I can eventually open up and talk a lot, but that's more so when I spend a lot of one-on-one time with them. I do go back to thinking about nursing from time to time as well as dental hygiene but I’m just so confused. I'm 23 rn if it helps at all. &amp;#x200B;If anyone has any suggestions for majors that may be a good fit for me, I'd really appreciate it.
juspsc	1605471738	216	Hi Redditors.  I’m currently a licensed school social worker in the state of MN.  I have a bachelors degree and am dual licensed (Board of Social Work and Dept of Ed), I do not have a masters degree, figured this info would be relevant since I’m not a therapist and couldn’t apply for online jobs requiring MSW.  The school I work for has been full distance since September.  I’m finding that I quite like working from home and don’t have a strong desire to go back into the building.  Also I’ve been in education 15+ years and I’m feeling the burnout.  I want to try something new.  I make about 50k a year and would love to stay close to that.  I’ve looked on indeed but some of the WFH jobs look sketchy.  Plus I do need/want full benefits.  I was thinking of trying flexjobs.  Has anyone had success finding decent paying jobs on that site?  Does anyone know of other good companies where my skill set could be utilized that offer remote work?  Im really open to any position as long as there is decent pay and good benefits. Basically any insight you can offer is greatly appreciated!  Many thanks in advance.
jtisjz	1605284795	128	Title says it all. I have years of experience under my belt but I am sick of this field for a multitude of reasons. I’m not interested in related fields like lab work with animals or pet insurance, not interested in retail or food service. I have strong skills in medicine, computer skills, and customer service, but no credentials.What are some good positions I could try to go for? Ideally something I could keep my current wage rate of around 23.50/hr and or go higher in. I’m based in California, if that helps at all.Please note that going back to school does not mean I would be opposed to taking a class to get a license or certification, I am just uninterested in going back long term. Thank you!
jr6b2z	1604955774	328	Hi everyone,I'm so torn. I'm a psych BA who took years off and is working in social work currently (not therapy.) I'm 26. I feel like I need to make a decision soon because I may want to have a family and want to become financially stable in a reasonable amount of the time.But I took these years off because I just cant decide. I don't know if I have a specific passion but I love helping others work through problems, progress, understand themselves, and to see people improve. I want to do good in the world. Everyone tells me I'd make an amazing therapist. My self esteem isn't great but the few traits I truly value about myself are my empathy, kindness, understanding of psychology and ability to communicate with others. I really love psychology.  However, becoming a therapist would be an extremely difficult road for me. I barely make any money now and there are no local schools to attend evening classes at. Even if I figured out the education aspect, it would be at least 3 years to the MSW plus a few years for licensing and even then many licensed MSWs tend to average 40 to 50k per year....and that is after gaining so much debt. I could do private practice, but that would take even longer to establish and still seems to average not much more with the costs of running a business plus I have no idea how apt I am to run one. Additionally there is the emotional trauma one can incur (burnout, suicide cases, vicarious trauma etc.)On the other hand I do have interest in both computer science and medicine as well since a young age. I could go into either of these- getting a computer science degree or becoming a physicians assistant- and the outcome would look much better. However I have no idea how much I would actually enjoy these jobs and whether I would feel fulfilled.Any advice?
jo8nnw	1604536602	144	Currently an RN working in an ER. For many reasons, I'm nervous of burnout in a few years and am thinking about shifting career paths. I am passionate about my education, but theres a lot that bothers me about working as a bedside nurse and I dont find this worth it in the long run. I currently have my associates, and currently working on my Bachelors in Nursing online. I have a few paths in mind:1. Finding a job away from bedside nursing with my Bachelors. 2. Getting my masters degree in nursing education, MBA, or nursing informatics3. Switching career paths altogether. I've had interests in biochemistry, engineering, etc as a teenager and first few years of college. I switched to nursing because I wanted a stable career when I graduated and *thought* I liked patient care. How do I go about navigating through this?
jlju8w	1604156554	128	I took a few month's break after ten continuous years of service in my career due to severe stress. I'd lost motivation to work and the stress started impacting the quality of my work and my health as well. So I decided to cool off for a few months. It helped a lot and now I feel much better. I started looking out again with a fresh perspective but no luck so far. First question they always ask is why did I leave and when I tell them I needed a break, I think it affects my chances of getting the job. Also since my previous stint was just a year long. How do I get back in the field? How do I assure them it won't happen again?
jjbq41	1603838395	52	We are loking at creating workshops / presentations for mid-sized companies to discuss burnout, growth, and adaptivity (Zoom / in-person). Has anyone had any experience as a corporate speaker, and what is the best way to "cold call" companies outside of your network to get up and running?For context, we are in Vancouver.
jj8kbk	1603828660	233	Hey all,* Have any of you emailed companies you want to work for asking if they'd be interested hiring you as an intern? (remote or in-person)* Did said internship result in a job offer- was it worthwhile?* If you've worked at startups how has the experience been, good, bad- challenging?I majored in Political Science but couldn't find a job immediately after college. Eventually I found an admin-esque job focused on scheduling flights for a company, it required me to move across the country. But I got to continue to invest in something I'm passionate about and I wanted to move anyway.I lost that  job about 5 months ago, primarily due to COVID. The switch to WFH didn't go well for a lot of people at the company. Burnout was rampant, communication via Zoom caused an interpersonal disconnect and people simply didn't work the hours they were contracted to. After I left my manager got demoted. (At the exit interview I was told in the last 4 years turnover has been in excess of 200%)Since leaving I've gotten a few non-remote job offers but none at a salary on which I can support myself. *(Afford rent, food, other necessities)*As time passes I'm getting more and more desperate to be gainfully employed. It's really frustrating.  I only really have admin experience on my resume but know I have the potential for so much more.
jfoci6	1603323273	614	I’ve been experiencing burnout pretty hardcore at my job. I (24F) work 52+ hours per week, in a live-in position at a group home for teenagers removed from the home. I love the kids I work with (for the most part), but I’m getting so worn down by the job itself and the lack of support. The long and excessive hours, the “living there” aspect (not having a physical escape/separation from the place), the lack of adequate staffing to assist me, and the complete lack of support and care from administration... it’s really getting to me. I feel so disconnected from my job, like I’m just going through the motions, and I can’t even force myself to care about anything. All I look forward to are my breaks and the weekends. I already likely have mild depression to begin with, and this burnout is severely impacting my mental health, to the point where I feel like I’m becoming a bore to my loved ones because it’s like my only personality traits are “hates her job” and “is sad and anxious constantly”. I feel like my mind is on a tightrope, wobbling and ready to plummet any day now. Plus, the stress is impacting me physically. I’ve had persistent stomach problems for month that I’m trying to heal, but I think being constantly stressed it’s not going to heal at all. In general, most of my kids I work with are awesome, and I have a nice deal having my own living space rent free in the home, and I keep telling myself to try to focus on those positives to make it through, but... it’s not working. The cons keep outweighing the pros. I have good days (or rather, good parts of days), I just... can’t escape the burnout feeling. I’ve been trying to come up with an “escape plan”—a plan to save as much money as possible for maybe another year (at the most), and to leave after that year is up. I would like to have a sizable chunk of savings. I’m not sure yet about my living situation, if I’ll move back in with my mom afterwards or look for an apartment or even a house. I don’t know if I’m financially ready for an apartment yet, or to add rent or a mortgage to my monthly bills. I’m thinking of looking into case worker/case manager positions, something that’s more removed/not direct care, but maybe still with the population I’m currently working with. Ideally, if I do one more year here and then leave, I’d like to have maybe a full month off before I start a new job just to recalibrate. The bottom line is that I don’t want to leave immediately. I don’t have anything in order to leave immediately. I don’t like giving up on stuff in general, but I can definitely feel myself wearying as time passes. Even after I went on a week-long vacation, I returned and felt exactly the same as I did before I left. I really do need to save money, figure out a living situation, and a plan for my next job before I leave. Like I said, for financial reasons, I’d like to try to make it another year, but if it gets really bad for me, I might not make it that far. Is there any way to truly deal with burnout other than... quitting? Any way I can make this more manageable for myself while I’m still here? Do you think it’s unhealthy for me to stay much longer? Has anyone else been in this situation, and did it get better for you (and how)? Any help would be appreciated.
jez9ju	1603229873	503	I currently work for  a privately owned business. I started part time four years ago, it was my first non retail job after grad school. Two years ago I was promoted to a full time assistant manager position; it’s not my dream job and not even in my field but I took the job because the benefits were ok and I needed full time work. Generally it’s been a good job and there are some definite perks, but it’s also very demanding and stressful.About four months ago the owner/manager decided to go into partial retirement. They come in a few times a week to do payroll and check up on things and that’s pretty much it. Since then I have taken on the majority of the clients and am essentially the manager; there is only one other full time person being trained to take some of the burden. I meet with the majority of the clients and the other full time staff member and I manage the employees 50/50.Before the manager went into retirement I was already expected to go into work on my days off if necessary and work overtime without additional pay, and my vacation time capped out at two weeks two years ago. I have not gotten a raise since I took over the majority of the clients, and due to things being slower to Covid I haven’t gotten any of my usual bonuses this year. I’ve essentially taken a pay cut with added responsibilities.The other issue is the business owner has not been great about Covid precautions; I feel like I am the only one reminding staff to wear masks and social distance in the office. We currently have one employee waiting on Covid test results but because they don’t have a fever the owner wants them to come into work. To be fair, I do get to set my own schedule within limits and can leave early if I need, but the overall culture the owner has established where the expectation is that you work overtime makes it difficult for me to do this without feeling guilty.Essentially I feel overworked and underpayed in an environment that seems to value money over the health and safety of our clients and staff.My family is pressuring me to quit because they feel the job is taking a toll on my mental and physical health. I agree, as I’ve started having anxiety attacks related to work. But I don’t have anything else lined up and there’s no guarantee another job would be any better.I know this is more of a rant than a specific question, but any general advice on how to proceed? Is it normal to feel burned out to this extent, especially in such stressful times? I am thinking of cutting back to part time while developing my skills or going back to school to make a career change, but I feel like my current job is very dependent on me and I feel guilty for even thinking of leaving.
jabf8a	1602588145	105	Hi. Throwaway here. I'm currently experiencing a high degree of burnout (whether because of undiagnosed mental health issues or not, IDK) that is affecting my job performance. It is probably too late for normal interventions (e.g., leave) and I expect to be terminated soon.  I've begun looking for new jobs, but I don't expect to find one before things come to a head with my current employer. (And given the burnout, I'm.not even sure rushing into another job is prudent) How do you recommend I address the termination in future interviews? Should I preemptively resign to avoid that awkwardness? Or wait it out?  Thanks.
j7exad	1602170310	93	Hey everyone, I’ve been getting pretty burned out from my job. Mainly because we’re short staffed due to COVID and that I’m advancing in a new position I’ve never been in before. I know that people typically say vacations are good for this because it lets you step away from the job and take a break, but right now with everything going on I can’t take a vacation yet, at least not until we’re a bit more staffed and situated.So for the time being, what are some great ways to cope with work burnout?
j687mk	1602001738	142	I’ve had a content writing job for 2 years now and I am completely and utterly burnt out. I procrastinate on my work for as long as I can. The work is just so mentally draining due to being so research intensive. I also struggle to focus and have ADHD so it makes it even more complicated. Sometimes it takes me 12+ hours to write one 4,000 word article. I don’t get paid overtime as the job I have is paid per word, rather than per hour.I know I need a break, but I simply can’t afford to take one. I live paycheck to paycheck and my spouse relies on me to work as they are disabled. I have no health insurance so I can’t go to a therapist about any of this. What can I do? Has anyone had a similar experience?
j4ofao	1601765406	716	Here it goes:  I’ve been working for the same company for the past eight years.  During that time I have received promotions, pay raises, and have developed professionally; however, during the past couple of years the company culture has changed and I feel as though I am in a toxic work environment with little room to move upward.  The job has been very demanding during the past two years and I have been extremely stressed out.  I decided late last year that 2020 would be the year I changed jobs. In June of this year, I received and accepted a job offer outside of my current company with better pay and benefits.  When I provided my current employer with a two week notice, I was surprised to receive a counter offer with more pay and an option to work remotely long term (currently working remotely and the company says they are looking into a long term solution).  I was stunned and questioned did I really want to leave a company who wanted me there so bad?  I initially rejected the counteroffer and then a few days later, asked for my job back.  My boss’s boss made a way for me to have my job back and rescind my resignation. After a month passed, I began to have the same feelings of burnout, exhaustion, and frustration.  I was passed over for a position that I was very well qualified for which stung a bit.  After this event I began to search for opportunities outside of my current company.  I applied for a permanent remote position with better pays and benefits.  To my delight, I got the job after two interviews! I have accepted the position but have not told my current employer yet.  I will need to notify my current employer by the end of this week in order to provide sufficient notice that I’m leaving.  The new job is everything I want - more money, more growth opportunities, better benefits, permanent telecommute option - I even have the opportunity to have a pension in addition to retirement!  Despite the position being everything I could want - I am afraid to take the leap.  I’m very concerned about the economic climate and the pandemic and being out of a job if the economy continues its downward spiral.  The new job is with a company that is in the midst of a merger that began last year.  The company currently has a hiring freeze in certain business segments; however, the segment I would work in is growing.  I confirmed with the company that this is not a temporary position.  I am afraid of leaving a company that I have been with for eight years who even let me return to my job after declining a generous counter offer.To further complicate matters, I had my review this past week with my current job (knowing I have already accepted a position with another company) and received a very nice pay raise and very positive feedback from my boss.  At the same time, I felt very disconnected from my boss and felt as though she wasn’t listening to me.  I am very grateful to be employed; however, I am extremely frustrated in my current role and company.  If it weren’t for the pandemic, I would accept this other job without any hesitation.  Financially speaking, I have enough savings for eight months.  I asked my boss during my review of working remotely was a possibility long term and all she said was the company was looking into it.  I am immunocompromised and being able to telecommute long term is very important to me.  I feel almost guilty or ungrateful for leaving my current job and know once I provide a two week notice this time that my bridge will be burned forever with the company.  As of now I am leaning toward accepting the new job but am having issues being comfortable with the amount of uncertainty associated with the job change, especially in this economic climate.  Is changing jobs too risky right now? Should I wait until the economy stabilizes before changing jobs?
j3hsny	1601587937	206	Hello, I would like to quit my job- due to being unhappy, mental burnout and exhaustion and no salary increase since January 2019 but a definite increase in responsibilities. Had an evaluation in February that went well, but in March the pandemic hit and raises came to a halt. I am fatigued but have a pretty good relationship with my boss and team, and me ‘jumping ship’ is a huge inconvenience for them and I know If I resigned tomorrow they’d ask me to stay another month to cover them. And I probably would. My thing is, how to resign without burning the bridge to get a future reference? I do not have a job lined up so I think it’s possible in my job hunt they could be given a call for reference. Any advice on anyone whose been in this position? what Should I say when they ask why?, because I don’t expect me saying “I’m unhappy” will cut it and they’d not be inclined to give me a good reference.I’ve only done this once before and I think I remember just saying I’m looking for other opportunities. But I was much younger and now I need a more corporate world answer. Thanks in advance!
j3fzpr	1601582241	210	Job Search BurnoutHi everyone,New to this sub but just a little rant/ looking for advice. I recently graduated from college and worked hard to build my resume through internships and experiences. I’ve been looking for jobs lately and was thankful to have gotten 3 interviews, but rejected from all of them. I’m consistently reaching out to people on LinkedIn, having conversations with them, they say they’re happy to help and can offer a referral when a position opens up, and once a position opens up and I message them again they never respond again. My strategy has always been connecting with people, building a relationship and then asking if they would be able to refer me for a position/ be able to connect me with a recruiter so that my application isn’t overlooked. But it’s starting to just become a cycle that leads to nowhere. Does anyone else just feel burnt out looking for jobs? Any advice on how I can find a role and land an interview? Has anyone had luck with just blindly applying to roles without a referral and getting an interview? Let me know where you all are in this process. Hope to learn from one another and maybe see that I’m not alone in this feeling!

j31xte	1601527146	193	TLDR at the bottom;I am a young professional and my biggest concern with work right now is learning how to say no to things, set limits of what I am willing/not willing to do, etc.Last semester they asked me to step up from assistant teacher to full time teacher for 4 classes (3 different curriculums) and DIDNT raise my wage. I am also a full time masters student. Needless to say I burned out.This semester I’m in a role that is more appropriate for my skill level, but I am essentially doing the work of two people. I want to learn from my mistakes and make my degree my priority. I don’t mind working less hours and losing some money. I just don’t know how to approach this without coming off as unaccountable or uncommitted. I have a solid job but feel that some accommodations could make my life easier. Advice on how to set boundaries, communicate my needs etc.TLDR; How do you communicate to your employer that your being spread thin by everything you’re doing on the time allotted? Trying to hand over some responsibilities and potentially reduce hours? Don’t want to burnout
j2uixn	1601499302	325	Hello!I started out in the company I currently work for in a different role/with a different supervisor. I think they are the greatest supervisor I could ever possibly have but I took a different position in the company because it was full-time and not just temporary. For about the first 2 months I was cool with this job but it suddenly became the worst thing in my life. I had a plan to make it to April before I started job searching but I had to put that on hold. Not too long ago, I reached the 1 year mark in this position. It was around that time when I was able to see that I am the second lowest paid employee in this company. We are not doing raises of any kind this year but I need a good increase in salary soon because I need to move out of my parents house lol. So I've been applying to jobs for about the last month. Here is my situation. There is going to be a position for my old wonderful supervisor that will need filled very soon. The pay is significantly higher than what I make now. I have all the experience for the way the job description is written (for the person who just left). It would be great. Given the nature of the job, I would have to work outside of 9-5 (I am currently in a 9-5 situation which is key to my mental health). All sounds good, right? Well I absolutely hate the company I work for. It's like a burnout factory here in addition to me feeling like our morals don't always align. Will I get that same feeling from a different company? Possibly. So I guess the advice I'm looking for is what do you do when you could potentially take a job and work for an amazing supervisor, but it's a position in a company that you loath?
j2na02	1601476495	511	I posted here recently but deleted my post quickly due to its vagueness. I feel that I have narrowed my options significantly since that last post. Anyways, here is what I'm thinking.I recently graduated with a masters degree in criminology at a top university in Canada. There is nothing wrong with my degree per se, but I have noticed I am always aiming for jobs that are at the fringe of what my education qualifies me for, in addition to my all over the place experience (customer service, research, legal work, social services). For example, I have basically ruled out all the jobs criminology graduates usually strive for, such as law enforcement, probation and parole, bank security, court services, etc. I have always wanted to obtain a job as a policy analyst or researcher on a issue relating to my discipline, but these jobs are practically non-existent where I am living and I don't have the network to access the hidden job market. I have maybe seen a handful of postings for policy analysts in my area in the past month. Overall, I've been entertaining the idea of going back to school to round off my education and have come down to three choices, with both their pros and their cons, although I am still considering pushing forward in finding full-time work. Generally I am interested in four key criteria:* Making a good amount of money* Work/life balance* Helping others or improving systems* Opportunities for growth or self-employmentHere is the education and roles I am interested in currently:Social Worker | Master of Social Work (MSW)Pros:* Helping others* Ability to work anywhere in Canada* Opportunity for self-employment* Plethora of positions and responsibilities available (hospital work, gerontology, injury rehab, etc) Cons:* Very little pay* Emotional toll * High burnout rate* Frustration at a critically broken system** Professor | PhD in criminology or sociology (PhD) **Pros* Paid extremely well* Job security once tenured and excellent benefits* Ability to combine teaching and research into one packageCons* Very little opportunities and hard to get into a full-time tenured position* Not exactly the best work/life balance* Having to potentially apply for grants every research projectLastly, I have considered going back to school to pursue something completely unrelated to my degree. I absolutely loved what I studied and achieved very good grades, but if I weigh my previous two options with other potential jobs (nursing, IT) that I can get if I go back to school and get the appropriate experience through internships, then I could potentially be working in a completely different industry in 3 years time, which is on par with these other degrees. I've been very hesitant about this because I haven't actually worked in my field yet. Does anyone have any insights or opinions to offer me? I feel like I am at a critical stage where I can decide to just suck it up and gain experience through internships or work at a unrelated job, or go back to school to pursue something more lucrative and further build my skills. Any help is appreciated!
j2mvpe	1601475193	238	This may not be the place to post this so I apologize in advance if anyone feels their time was wasted reading it.I’ve been a critical care RN for the last five years and started an acute care nurse practitioner program this January. Around the same time I started feeling extreme disengagement, disappointment, and burnout. Then COVID hit and the massive patient death, declining compassion, and shear horror of some of the cases has provided me near-PTSD.Prior to critical care I did nursing in different forms. I am 27 and have been a licensed nurse for the last 11 years as I attended a technical program.I have no side jobs or hobbies. My interests are few. I do enjoy end-of-life and palliative but working outpatient hospice was also terrible as it is after all a business.I do truly enjoy teamwork and interacting with patients just as I enjoy learning patho physiology and the science of medicine.My NP education is disappointing and becoming a physician doesn’t seem like the right thing to do either.I wanted to know if anyone can offer any soul-searching or grounded advice if they’ve ever experienced this kind of a situation.I’m at the point where I’m not sure what capacity I still want to function in within healthcare or if I want to leave this industry altogether.This constant autopilot is sputtering out. I am currently awaiting a leave of absence for mental health.Any advice is welcome.

j2ab00	1601420493	154	25F dev here. I've been struggling to find motivation because of lack of interaction with my officemates and it's taking a huge toll on my productivity. Most of the devs were hired from the context of being a team player in a non-WFH setting. Now's everything changed, I doubt even our management is prepared for this shift in our dynamics. There hasn't been intervention from our managers, little to no pep talks to motivate us. I think the management is expecting us to have the same energy. Managers weren't checking on our mental state. I've been very unproductive but I am not yet called out. I'm hesitant to reach out to my manager about my burnout case because I haven't heard a single pep talk from them. So I'm trying to be compassionate and understand that they're prolly also clueless and stressed. Given that, what can/should I expect from our managers during this COVID19 period?
j24lyo	1601402529	253	Sorry in advance if this post is a little all over the place. The purpose is to express that I'm at a crossroads in my career and I'm having trouble being decisive. I'm pretty unhappy with my current position. I've worked as a software engineer for 3.5 years, at the same company since I graduated college. I've considered a career field change altogether but this terrifies me because I have no clue where to start, this is all I've gone to school for and all I have experience in. I dialed it back a bit and tried for a more lateral change-- applying for other software engineering jobs. Long story short I got called back for a second interview later this week and when I did get the call, I was just sort of filled with dread. I'm worried that I'm trapping myself in another unsatisfactory, stressful situation similar to the one I'm in.I think I desperately need a bigger career shift, but I'm not sure if I'm just blinded by the burnout and constant crushing stress I'm under at my current job. I also feel guilty for wasting the time of this company who has interviewed me if I don't choose to move forward with them. I feel like I am in with only one foot in every direction, so I'd like to know how do you face dissatisfaction with your career? What do you do with all the indecision? Has a career shift impacted your life negatively/positively? Any input is greatly appreciated
j1lse0	1601329836	112	Hi!I've been in the architecture, construction industry for about 7 years in design and project management roles.

iyd11d	1600877229	221	Most careers typically require a resume, but "creative" jobs, not only require a resume, but a portfolio, a website is usually mandatory, and some employers even ask for spec work.So on top of tailoring your resume to match the interests of the employer, you have to tailor your portfolio as well. This is not as easy as tailoring resumes, because the work is visual in nature and it just comes down to wether the employer likes it or not. Does that mean you have to make a different portfolio everytime you apply for a job?People often give advice about focusing on numbers and measurable results in your resume, how do you do that in creative type of work with sounding like someone pulling numbers out of your ass?How do you value your work? Know your worth when you're working in a creative field? It always feels like you're constantly trying to prove to everyone that your job and career is legit and worthy of respect, as opposed to focusing your energy on working hard, rather than selling hard.Maybe it's the same in other careers?What's a good career to switch to, if you're just too burned out to keep up?What did you do to avoid burnout if you want to keep your career?I'm talking about things similar to graphic design and the like.

iustrv	1600378056	364	I manage a team where each person does a very specific job, with many variable tasks, that requires someone to specialize in the role. Each person's regular work takes up about their whole shift, though on lighter days they get extra work done.We've been dealing with a lot of issues and burnout from team members taking vacation. It requires the duties to be split amongst the team, and while some accomodate it better than others, most are frustrated. The team is resentful of members taking vacation time due to the extra work, and feeling burned out. When the team members come back from their vacation, work is either still piled up, or done incorrectly, due to the fact it's not a regular occurrence the other team members have to cover their work.We did hire members who were designed to be a "jack of all trades", specialized in all roles to assist on heavy days or cover for people. However, my boss decided that they need to have important duties of their own when they're not helping/covering, but these duties still need to be done even when they are covering, so it means we end up in the same position: the regular work needs to be finished while covering a desk, so they either end up doing the work of a little less than two people, or have to split their normal role up with the team while they focus entirely on covering someone else. When checking in with a new hire, they said they felt the training for their position was severely lacking and that they're exhausted by the end of each day. They said that no matter how heavy a day is on work (the work days are incredibly variable in workload), they feel they are just expected to accomadate it, and it feels like a very "everything is the priority" environment (especially when covering extra work). Apparently other managers had gotten upset at them when they asked to prioritize work on a busy day, telling them everything needed to be done. I'm not sure what to do about this, maybe alternate the jobs each week so everyone knows everything? What is the answer?
itctpy	1600189134	144	I’ve been in my role for almost a year now, but due to Covid we’ve been working from home. Recently both half our team was cut, as well as a few people have been out of the virtual office sick, so I took on a massive project by myself. It took multiple days working 12+ hours (early mornings/late evenings) to get it finished. After it wrapped I asked my boss if I could take an extra half day off to rest due to the overload/burnout and was refused. They said “you’re salaried so the hours are the hours”. I’m just curious if this is this...normal? If I didn’t work until midnight some days the job wouldn’t have been finished, so I feel like an extra half day off is a drop in the bucket compared to my mental health. In the U.S. if it matters.
ipiudh	1599667621	230	Not sure if this is the right sub to post this or not, but here goes nothing. I've been working as a software developer for the last 3 or so years. Went to school for a related degree (did not study software at all though) and landed a job out of college that paid really well for someone my age. Ever since then I've just kinda stuck to this industry. I knew this was not what I wanted to do with my life and have desperately been wanting to change careers. I think I'd enjoy a business Analyst or product manager type roll much more. Anyway, ever day I wake up I dread going to work. I've been unmotivated and stressed out for the last year and a half. In the last year I've accepted 2 new positions since my first job. Both new jobs just led to more dissatisfaction and stress when I was hoping the change of pace would help me be happier. I really hate thinking about the future right now. I just know it's going to make me even more depressed thinking about it. I feel burnt out and unmotivated.I'm so tired of always feeling like this about work, a place that literally takes up over half of my waking hours.So, how did you recover from this feeling/change your career? I really could use some advice here.
ilgrna	1599084525	94	I've gotten into personal finance a while ago and I'm pretty sure I'm passionate about it but I have doubts about going in that direction regarding college. Even though most of the finance oriented majors aren't really appealing there are some that seems to suit my interests like 'industrial and tax law'. Apart from simply losing interest or the major turning out different than I anticipate I'm afraid of the infamous burnout. To add context, I also have other ideas on what to pursue including a personal buissness. What do you think? 16yo foreigner btw
ild0k2	1599073065	455	I'm pretty high up in my company/career (Director level) but i've got little to nothing driving me anymore besides the check (i get paid well however). I've worked in ad agencies my entire career as a creative (10+ years now) and i used to get fired up over cool new client work, be proactive, ambitious etc. Now i get frustrated, anxious, lazy, and I could really care less about some dumb website or whatever i'm working on. Maybe it's because as i get older i slowly realize nobody really cares about advertising and what i'm doing except people in advertising. I should note, that i still somehow find a way to make clients happy and produce decent work. But i'm on auto pilot. I'm droning along, cranking out the same old shit. I should note that I don't think i'm depressed or anything like that (outside of work anyway) i'm just tired of work/working and sort of in a weird area of career limbo.\&amp;nbsp;I find myself sifting through job posts every day, applying to very very few. 2-3/month maybe, and even the ones i apply to i don't really want to do deep down (although i could, am qualified, it might be better, meh, etc). I'm just sort of stuck in this 'i don't know what to do now/next' zone and have little motivation towards work. I've looked into client side... meh, doesn't really interest me. I've looked into other areas of the industry/digital as well with the same pessimism. I do the 'what do i want to be doing in 5 years, 10 years, etc' game and can't answer it. I have no idea.\&amp;nbsp;I get rather anxious thinking about it and i think about it daily and get stuck in this loop:\- God i hate my job... i should look for a new job\- none of these jobs interest me and what if i hate it as much as i hate my current job, that'd be worse\- maybe i should change careers, but what would i do?\- i make good money, why would i change careers and make less? I'm good at what i do and get paid well... \- i guess i'll stick it out a little longer\- but god i hate my job... i should look for a new job\&amp;nbsp;I don't know what i'm after as far as advice really... I know i need a change from either this job, or this career entirely, but i've done all the tests, i've thought long and hard about this for months to no avail. I'm just stuck in this endless thought loop and can't break free of it. It's like i'm stuck in the movie 'Groundhog day' basically. Will happily discuss if you have questions/suggestions.
ijytyp	1598883601	489	I am officially a work from home employee since March but the stress levels of my job and my responsibilities have tripled since the pandemic. In February we added a new CCO and she is over my department- I do marketing and graphic design. Newly created position. With the pandemic I have spoken to her once.  She wants to have a larger social media presence and so we hired someone to do that. Problem is that it  is creating additional work for me. Tons of additional work. To the point that I cannot get my other responsibilities done and it is causing me extreme stress. I havent gotten a pay raise in 2 years but got a promotion from hourly to salary in January and now all I do is work. When the pandemic hit they "requested" we use ALL our vacation time before the end of the 2nd quarter to help with the "bottom line" even though my company has already made budget this year. My boss did not make it sound like an option. I used the 2 weeks i had saved up. Now I need them more than ever. Also we are making money hand over fist in the pandemic and have NEVER been busier. We are slammed. My sales team that I support are running themselves in circles with orders.Personally I also started doing Doordash  part-time on the weekends to help make some extra money since me and hubby need it with him not working like he was before covid. I make enough to support our bills but not our lives. But I am having nightmares. I cant keep up with the demands or the regular tasks I am supposed to be handling. Things are getting left behind. I am having nightmares. I cant work all the time but I am. I am tethered to my desk and phone at all times for work. I feel guilty going and doing anything. The Burnout  is so strong. I want to quit. But I am trying not to. I actually love my job when it isnt like this. I am invested in the people there and want to see it succeed. With this new CCO the culture has been changing. It isnt good either. She is harsh and not very enjoyable to be around. I love my direct boss and his boss. Our whole team really. We work well together and have for 7+ years and before she came along we knew when to take breaks. Now... and with being work from home and not in an office... i have no concept of a break.  Work is all consuming. It is all I feel I have a right to be doing with me so far behind. I just want to throw my phone and desktop in a lake and start a farm. I am so worn out and I feel  so inadequate.
iiw6kw	1598721348	183	Mid 30's, live in Socal making mid to low $50k. Managing restaurants for 6, almost 7 years now. Due to some recent health concerns and just a general burnout from the industry (started at 16 working restaurants and majority of experience is that waiting tables) and coming to the realization I dont want to be a GM or RGM in restaurants. What direction can I shift my career into? On paper I have a BA and MFA, both feel useless as I never pursued anything with them (B - Communication &amp; M - Game Design) and as a father of two young boys I just want to make enough money to support and provide for my family and feel my current salary is not enough for where I live.Thought about looking to get a certification and go into HR as I feel that a lot of my restaurant management experience deals with that. Not sure if  I should go back to school or what but feeling really  stuck and also due to covid feel like I shouldn't make moves.Thanks for any advice!
iiqh6p	1598698326	122	I've been teacher for a while now and I'm feeling incredibly burned out. I just don't want to do it anymore. I really don't know what I could or should do instead, but I need a career. What are some jobs that I might like or be good at. I'm good at researching topics in depth and organizing information and data. I'm quite meticulous, but I'm not a creative person. I speak 2 languages fluently. I have a degree in accounting and I'm good with numbers.  I don't  mind if suggestions might require additional schooling, although at the moment that would be difficult. I'd  really appreciate any suggestions because the burnout is killing me and I need a career change.
igetmw	1598370786	282	I am ~30 and work for a large non-profit in a specialist position. I graduated with a mostly non-related arts degree and have spent my career thus far at a few non-profits. I've remained in mainly admin roles, and want to make a jump into a different position but am having trouble translating my skills into the next step for my career. I'm also deciding if I need to go back to school (masters, certificate program, etc). I have a couple mentor sessions scheduled at my organization, but would also like to hear the opinions of others from outside the non-profit bubble.I've gained a strong reputation for:- Developing and streamlining processes- Organizing projects/programs start to finish with internal/external partners- Training staff of all levels to use various programs/tools- Offering creative solutions when others trained in the field are stuck (however this is difficult to get credit for if needed for applications, etc. Bosses usually claim ideas as their own or it is developed as a team.) I enjoy being a connector and the "go-to" for all kinds of program details, technical questions, and resources. I am someone who likes to stay busy at work, have a cheerful disposition, and mediative personality.I dislike micromanagement, the typical assistant duties like scheduling travel and booking meetings, and work that stays with me after I've logged off for the day. I've been told many times I'd be a good counselor or school teacher but know I'd get empathy burnout.My job goals include the ability to work remotely from anywhere in the U.S. and to make a decent but not extravagant salary (think equivalent to $50s for a Midwest city). Do any job paths jump out at you?
ifrwcl	1598285273	82	This is my first year of working in corporate after college and I love it but I’m hitting a consistent wall. In college, if I wanted to take a break, I would just slow down until I felt better but I realize I can’t do that anymore. Luckily my job has a fairly healthy work vibe where taking time off and avoiding burnout is encouraged but I don’t know how to gauge when and how often someone should take a vacation. Any tips/help?
idwth4	1598016877	44	I been enjoying my job less and less working from I'm unmotivated to do it and engage with people. Personally for me, I would say working from home is 30% the issue,   70% me not be interested and ready for a career change.
ibjk3q	1597688175	298	*So a brief background:*   *I have a Bachelors AND a Masters in Kinesiology (exercise science, for those who dont know) and after working 6 years in this industry I have gained little-to-no career traction. Currently I am working 3 jobs (personal training and physical therapy) and I barely make 40K per year. My main dayjob at a clinic (and also 90% of my income) has converted to very toxic 'corporate' work culture, so all the signs are pointing to a career change and/or going back to school. I still enjoy my part-time work, but* *the main job has got to go**. Gyms are still closed in this state, so I can't exactly pickup more clients to makeup for that loss of income.*My main short-term goal is to get back to school by Fall of 2021 (would be sooner, but you know... COVID). So in the mean-time I'm trying to look for work to help support me before, and while I'm in school full-time. Long-term hoping to shift into new career in film, geography, environmental science or something I know I won't burnout from easily. I have various interests as you can see.**I'm seeking out suggestions for any well-paying career I can start either ASAP** (w/ little experience and a random college degree) **or anything that requires a certification/schooling/training I can complete within 6-12 months**. Only ideas I could come up with were working in a local bike shop, entry-level mechanic jobs, retail like REI or CycleGear, or even as a dispensary bud-tender as a last resort.Ultimate long-term goals are to **NOT** work 40 hours a week or 5 days a week, as I heavily value work-life balance and therefore would seek to spend more time with family while making livable income (I don't care about getting rich).
i9r887	1597429132	133	Little bit of a  backstory. I  Climbed the ranks from dishwasher at 17 to assistant  restaurant manager under the Gm at 24. Been grinding 6 days a week while everyone above and below me only does 5 a week . I love my employees most of which have been here as long as me but im loosing hope it will change and im so stressed and worn out i have brought that feeling home with me and my whole family can tell im not myself these past few months . What are the best ways to deal with burnout without asking for an extra day off or extra help because i dont want to seem like a cry baby because ive been doing it so long and not really complaining ?
i8lgls	1597263932	123	I have been doing retail for the better part of the last 10 years.  I’m finally to a point where it’s just not rewarding anymore.  I have been successful, made 10 stores profitable for one company, and made 2 stores profitable for my current company is just over a year. But I’ve finally hit my limit with lack of respect from customers and upper management who aren’t involved in day to day work.  For this who made the change from retail to another field what areas did you transition to and what are some skills you took from retail to those fields? I know I have skills to be in another industry just don’t know where to start.  Thank you!
i7hnp3	1597106762	577	 Hello, I am just looking for some advice as to what career to pursue. I have been taking my time to decide and years have gone by so I am hoping to come to my senses and stick with one path and rid of the other "distractions". I have just been jumping back and fourth between them. What I have learned from other posts is that a perfect career doesn't exist and that you learn to love what you do as you go. To try and find a career like I am trying to find a new hobby is not gonna work. I really excelled in math and science in high school. I went to a competitive and overcrowded university and I did not have direction while enrolling in my classes as a premed freshman. I ended up graduating with a bachelors degree in Philosophy with cumulative GPA 2.6. I took the LSAT 5 years ago and got a 140, but I did not get into any law schools. Ever since then I have been tinkering with website development, graphic designing and software engineering but I lacked the drive to master computer programming. (took online and unofficial classes). Although I am capable, I am searching for greater fulfillment in a career than just building a websites, like helping people stay healthy or helping the innocent be freed. Also from experience, I have an easier/better time working in a team, talking with people rather than just sitting in silence for most of an 8 hr shift and reviewing with a supervisor. I have been taking CC classes hoping to give physician assistant or even nursing a chance after raising my GPA. All I have left to take is one year biology, one year chemistry and physiology. Last semester I got straight A's. Should I stick with the plan and continue taking classes this upcoming semester, or try and apply to law school again after really putting an effort to study for the LSAT. Or better yet, should I forget about ever pursuing any of them and take computer programming more seriously and get skilled at it on my own. I am getting a slight burnout from school because I have been unemployed for a long time, with COVID forcing everything online, and I don't feel 100% committed to one career. Heck, I just finished an accounting class with an A, and even thought about maybe continuing to become a CPA, although that would mean as much schooling as taking premed prerequisites. I forgot to mention I am also a pretty good artist using both pencil and paints. My problem is I don't have letters of recommendations yet or any healthcare experience besides being a physical therapy/nursing home volunteer. The moment I find some hope with a direction, I find the fear of not choosing one of the other careers getting in the way. Accounting not so much since I just discovered it recently. I think web designer is easiest to decide on, more autonomy and I already have some experience. I think physician assistant is a slight deviation from a childhood dream of becoming a doctor. I think lawyer to get to try something new, build an infamous ego and partly continue doing philosophy. What should I do? I also thought about working towards a masters in social work, or a masters in psychology but the job seems less of a fit for me as a slight introvert.
i5k5qy	1596827968	536	TL;DR: emotionally exhausted at work (prior to Covid), have four kids and a home, wife's business doesn't provide income yet (has potential to replace/exceed mine), she doesn't have the energy to focus on hers because of kids and home, my work is not a good fit for me yet I have no other potentials (other than hobby), for my own mental health and the sake of my marriage and family I want to quitSo I've been in engineering for about 7 to 8 years now and I'm starting to get burnt out. I just started a new position at the beginning of March and I have been having to learn my position, how to work at home with four young kids, and while my wife is working on her business. To say the least, it's been stressful.Prior to all of this, I've been feeling burnt out for two years now, changing positions within my company a few times to see if something else fits. I've come to the slow conclusion that I don't care for the industry I'm in, and even more so I don't care for engineering. In fact my degree is in physics, not engineering.My burnout has been greatly impacting my family life. My wife and kids get the last dregs of my energy when I get home and I'm irritable and I have been a bit more so at times working from home.I love woodworking and have been making wood boxes the last year and it has been waaaaay more enjoyable and satisfying than just working for the man. In fact in looking back on my interviews I've always told them my greatest strength and passion is working and creating with my hands. The challenge is that my boxes aren't really selling enough to replace my income and my wife's business, while having the potential to be more profitable than my venture, hasn't taken off yet. (Hers is an online subscription service of sorts.)My wife hasn't been and to give herself fully to her business since she's been taking care of the kids and the home (part time since I've been home, even before I did what I could to do my part so she wasn't exhausted). I don't know what I want to do for my career, I'd like it to be my woodworking, but with my current job I just don't feel I have the energy to consider think about what to do.I know for a fact that my career is not a good for me, I'm just scared to pull the trigger and quit, take care of my kids and home, while my wife gives more of her energy to her business. Part of it is that we don't have savings right now, we have average debt, and a home mortgage.I'm at a loss because I believe in what my wife is doing, but it's not replacing our income fully. At the same time I just I don't feel I can do what I'm doing anymore because I'm just not giving any value to my company and its not fair to them. Has anyone else quit because their job isn't a good fit and it's ruining your relationship with your family?
i4gvip	1596671774	356	It may sound silly considering I’ve only been in this position and with this company for a year but I’m dealing with some serious burnout and I’m not sure what I should do.My position has a bit more stress than others because of the constant deadlines associated with responding to RFXs and the overload of responding to multiple in a short timeframe while keeping up with other day to day tasks. I’ve also not been able to take vacation due to workload and work a lot of overtime. Although Im working a lot more hours, my productivity has dropped and I just feel stupid - like I’ve lost what I used to have. I’ve regressed professionally and personally over the past several months due to, what I believe, burnout.I’ve been a part time grad student and getting a masters is one of my biggest goals but I haven’t even registered for fall classes. I feel completely overwhelmed and think taking classes is setting myself up to fail at either school or work.The company is great and my manager is great but I still found myself looking at resignation letter templates just yesterday. So, I’m trying to decide what I should do.A) Resign without a backup plan, only enough money to last a few months (more if I dip into retirement), and search for a new jobB) Talk to my manager and ask if I can move to another position within the company (If I do this, I fear that I may be entertained while behind the scenes the company prepares to dismiss me)My main problem with B is the thought that expressing this to my manager will result in them wanting to get rid of me and thus being dismissed. I’ve never been fired and would much rather resign and potentially struggle for a couple of months than be fired for bringing this to my managers attention and getting fired and still struggling for a few months, potentially with a more difficult path to finding a new job due to being fired.I can’t believe I just typed all of that out. Anyway, any advice is much appreciated.
i04hbl	1596043011	206	I am basically looking as a "sinecure" to sustain a writing / singer-songwriting career until it manages to pay the bills with art.Many advice this kind of artists to get a side career - preferably not directly related to their creative means -I am available to get bachelor or master's level education (European country - no tuition fees).I would like to get a strong side profession that I can count on when not on an artistic income... \^\^"&amp;#x200B;My main likes and dislikes - outside of writing and music - are mostly: * people - I use to get very well with people, speak with a lot of random people, easily get a wide network;* Having some neurotic tendences, I get depressed and anxious quite easily - so I feel like I \*must\* avoid stressful and very competitive environments. I already got a medically relevant burnout while working as a door-to-door salesman in the past...* I also am not fond at all of numbers and hard sciences, so I would avoid stem fields and technology related. Am not also very well apt with electronics and repairs...&amp;#x200B;My bet was Management, with a specialization in Human resources, with the main aim of getting a government job or a teaching position...
hwqzeb	1595548100	363	TLDR: Should I take a non-profit role in LA or a startup role in London?I'll try to keep this all as brief as possible!:I currently work in London in a job which has seriously burnt me out &amp; I've been actively applying to other jobs for \~5 months. Two positions have started to line up (I still have final round interviews left, but seems like I will be extended offers to at least one and probably both) just now. Job 1: a growth stage startup in London, where I currently live (though I am a US citizen), which has a vibrant culture including happy hours twice a week, yoga in the office, etc... I really think the company and people seem genuine. The role is in procurement, which is similar to my degree and would lead to more concrete salary progression &amp; transferable roles. Job 2: an art/film non-profit in LA. The job itself I'm pretty overqualified for, but given my current burnout that almost seems appealing. The organization puts on a very big film event annually that I think is super cool &amp; employees receive passes and access to the event. I would love to break into the media industry, which this may allow me to do, but it would be starting low on the ladder and in a finance/accounting role so I don't know if it truly would help. I could relocate, but that would be an added hassle.The salary for the London job is £35k annually and the LA job is \~$48k annually. Both of these would be an adjustment for me since my current job is \~ £70k, but I save over half of my salary so I know I  could adjust to these salaries and this change is more motivated by being burnt out by this higher paying role, so I'm ready to accept this. I think £35k will go much further in London than $48k would in LA.Any advice? Any factors I'm not thinking about yet? I feel so conflicted, but blessed that at least I have options given this is about the worst time to realize you electively want to leave your job. Thanks in advance!
hvvm22	1595431120	509	Hey there everyone, I'd love to get some advice (whether you have experience doing either of these things or not) as to whether this sounds like a good idea...Simply put, as a (F24, 3 years qualified, Australian) lawyer, I do not vibe with my job at all. Between being extremely overworked, the constant immense pressure and deadlines, the office politics, toxic work environment and God-awful, entitled clients I think I am done with the lawyering world already. It is not as if I thought being a lawyer wouldn't have it's challenges, but it is extremely difficult to live like this day in and day out and I think this burnout will only continue at a dramatic rate if I keep this up. Others in my professional network feel the same, but tend to think there is no way out of the "trap" they feel they have got themselves in to - physically and mentally.I subscribe to a minimalist, simple living lifestyle in the sense that I would love more free time to spend with my loved ones, regardless of how big of a paycut I would have to take. I make a decent amount of money right now, but I never get time to spend it on experiences or treat my loved ones with it anyway, so what's the point? Anyway, for a few months now I have toyed with the idea of being a child care worker after it came to me in a dream (quite literally). The more I have thought about it, the more I would love to work in that kind of environment. Not to say the work is not challenging and that I wouldn't still have to deal with adult colleagues, but so much of that every day pressure I experience right now would simply dissipate. I would only have to study for a year to get the relevant diploma (after 4 years of studying a law degree I never thought I would go back to studying but here we are). I have even thought that, eventually, I could even start up my own family day care, perhaps.I think the thing that gets me is the expectations others have of me. I am someone who has always been academically inclined and achieved first class honours in my law program. I just feel like others would maybe see this as me "giving up" on the corporate world and seeing me as "unambitious", "not committed" or even "lazy" for drastically changing careers and going from a $80k a year salary to a wage that could see me earning anywhere between $45k-$55k a year. I think what I am asking is, has anyone else taken a drastic turn in their career and loved it despite the expectations placed on them and the monetary difference? Is this even a good idea? I know between myself and my partner our finances would still all be in order and we would not struggle... Am I just getting in to my own head too much about this? Should I take the plunge?

ht0psi	1595009485	117	I am 35 and tired of the burnout in my current position. Where do I begin when considering a career change when I don’t even know what I want to do?I have put my whole life and soul into my current job for the past 6.5 years but every year there is more and more work and not enough resources or time. I feel beat, I initially put in the extra work because I was told my my superiors that it was temporary now they take it for granted and I am feeling overwhelmed.To the point of depression and suicidal thoughts.I thought I was doing okay but then COVID -19 and some other personal problems happened as well.
hshajm	1594930054	483	I (25F - USA) have struggled with my career for several years and I really need help figuring out what to do with the rest of my life. Sorry if this is long.When I became old enough to work, I was a cashier at several places as well as a CNA, home health aide, and a general administrative assistant. The jobs were OK, but at that time, my eyes were on a different prize.I went to a technical school for computer information and worked in the IT field for 5 years, which I used to love. I have repaired computers, made cables (Ethernet, fiber, and coax), repaired laser printers, provided phone technical support for a company with ~800 end users, and then call center-level phone support with 80,000+ end users and 20+ programs/software. At the call center job, management ignored me and passed me up for all opportunities and gave them to other coworkers that had fewer skills than I do. It was the final straw with my burnout and I decided I wanted to do something more helpful and fulfilling. I contemplated programming before leaving IT, but I’m pretty terrible at it.After looking at my options, I decided I wanted to go back to school for the healthcare field as it seems like the best for helping people. I quit my full time IT job and found a part time job at a pharmacy to help get me through school. I planned to attend a technical school during the spring to become a licensed practical nurse (LPN) but the college had to shut down due to COVID-19. Ironically, the pandemic has made me realize that being on the front line like that is absolutely not what I want. I’ve been a cashier at a retail pharmacy for 5 months now. I like my coworkers and things aren’t bad, but I’ve realized I hate having to interact with customers. I was told when I accepted the job that they would help me become a certified pharmacy technician but I’ve been in the pharmacy maybe 3 times and classes are not on the horizon right now. Hours have also been severely cut at my store and I’m strictly doing cashier duties.I feel like I’m in a rut and wasting my potential. A cashier is not what I want to be and I’m not contributing enough money to my household when I only work 11 hours a week. I have taken hundreds of career tests and all of the suggestions they’ve given don’t seem to fit. I don’t have a particular field I want to go into, but I’d like to have less contact with the general public and work in a calmer environment. I have plenty of computer/software/troubleshooting skills, great communication and customer service skills, and am good with organization. What can I do with my skills that won’t require an associates/bachelors/etc degree? Thank you!
hrgvod	1594786544	184	So a little bit of background info....I have a BS in psych and I am currently enrolled in a masters program for clinical counseling specializing in sex therapy. I have worked for a local nonprofit mental health and substance use crisis center for the past 3 years. I do try and practice self care when possible but I can't keep up due to extreme burnout and compassion fatigue. Its draining my will to help indicate when I used to be super passionate about it. I know it's time to move forward for my sake and for the sake of clients. This Covid madness made job searching pretty difficult for a minute, however, I was interested in taking advantage of remote work (from home) while there has been more available. I feel like I just need a break, especially from the crisis world so I can maintain my own mental well-being. Seeing revolving door problems and not getting to see any of the progress is really statying to become defeating.. Any advice, shared experience, and ideas of where to go from here would be greatly appreciated.
hr6eat	1594749545	383	I am in a bit of an urgent decision situation - have to decide by today whether or not I want to matriculate to medical school. I'm 27, have been working in public policy and data analysis for the past 5 years. The alternative to medical school is to pursue a career in "data/software for social good" space.The pros to going to medical school:\- Sense of satisfaction at having helped someone in a direct way - never need to question whether the way you've spent your day is useful, because at least you were trying at something worthy\- Connecting with people from lots of walks of life\- Possibilities in case I can't do that much patient contact or hospital care - research, etc\- MCAT score expires this year, so reapplication would be a hurdle, plus I would need to beef up my application since this acceptance was actually from two years ago, (got a deferral)\- A somewhat protected profession, compared to data roles in tech - lots of competition there, have to hustle a lot to find your placeCons:\- I'm 27, the medical school is a 45 minute train ride from the closest metro area, and I would really like to find a partner at this point in my life and friends - I think I would just feel very isolated and resentful after living in the city for so long. The town and medical school are small and I just much prefer the people and the environment of the city.\- The large upfront financial commitment, and subsequent lack of flexibility - ie, can't just leave without consequences\- Requires a lot of memorization and not as much opportunity for big-picture thinking as say, public policy, and less room for creativity and strategizing on this big-picture scale. I know this is possible in medicine, but it's definitely not the default and I wonder if it's worth the cost\- Can't really work in a sector other than healthcare\- Scared of burnout among physicians, I've never been super comfortable in the hospital environment, makes me feel trappedAny advice at all would be appreciated, especially if you have a background in one or both of these fields! Any referrals to anyone who has made the med to tech or tech to med transition would also be super helpful.
hnld13	1594229431	270	I’m currently working in a career that I hate. So much so that I can’t even look forward to the weekends-I spend Saturday and Sunday just wrecked with anxiety about what I will return to at work on Monday. I have developed severe stress-related IBS, and I deal with work induced depression. It abated slightly when I changed companies, but now I’m at a place (been here 8 months) where it’s even worse than before (finally seeing my managers true colors). I have multiple side projects and passion projects that I would love to turn into a stream of income. I’m so burnt out at the end of my 10+ hour workday that the thought of working on more work (even work that I enjoy) seems like an insurmountable task. Yes, I am aware that people work much longer hours than I, but we all have different thresholds for burnout and exhaustion. I’m in $15k of debt, so the thought of having no reliable stream of income terrifies me more than the fact that I’d lose my insurance. I’ve already decided if and when it comes down to it, I will sell items around my home, be a dog walker, take odd jobs, etc but then I go into a circle of will I be back at square one with no time to actually develop my business because I’m spending so much time just trying to make ends meet? My question is-have you ever quit a job you hate with nothing lined up in order to pursue your dream? Do you have any advice for someone looking to take this leap?
hmqmll	1594110279	611	Here is a little background info before I ask my questions as it provides contextIm going into my senior year in high school and im taking my steps towards a business career much more seriously. I am pursuing a relatively high tier business job not just an average accountant, but also not a CFO or CEO as I dont think im a good enough leader for those roles. While im not set on a career I am more of leaning towards portfolio manager or high net worth financial manager. I am going to got to my local Junior College then transfer to a 4 year, as from what I have heard is that employers dont really care much about the name of the college past getting your first job where they will care much more about job experience and I figured I would save myself the headache of 30-50k in student loans and network and get job experience in college and come out in the same spot. I have heard differing opinions on that but from what I have gathered that is what I perceive as true/best option for me. I have been interested in learning finance and have been set on this career path since I was 13/14 and have been actively investing my money from my part time job for the last year now and have already become somewhat knowledgeable on balance sheets, income statements 10ks/10qs and overall evaluation of companies the same goes for personal finance. Im by no means an expert but I do feel as if I have an above average knowledge on these subjects especially in my age bracket (hate saying it like that but im just trying to give a gauge on everything ive learned so far)Here are some of my questions1. Once I complete High School what job do I get while in college and where do I look for it? An internship would likely have to be paid as I will still have expenses unless its low hours and idk where to look for an entry level job that provides networking and job experience. The only idea I have is a bank teller as that is entry level "finance" job and has contact with financial advisors although if I were to be one I would like to work for the high end clients not the average person (sounds pretentious but idk how else to put it).2. What do I do now? Do I continue learning and investing or should I actively seek out and network with people if so how do I go about that? Im not 18 yet so I doubt anybody will hire me and I wont be 18 until after high school so I have to wait to legally not be considered a minor for working until next summer.3. How am I doing for my age (almost 17) for achieving my career goals do you think im on track? Ahead behind? dont be afraid to give criticism I can take it.4. What specific jobs would you recommend, please leave the reasoning as well, pros/cons. My ideas so far are analyst, portfolio manager, and financial advisor (maybe investment banker but that might be to far out of reach and for people much smarter than I am as well as too high stress to continue for decades). I dont like jobs like a CPA or accountant as I like the investing aspect of the jobs and while im totally willing to work long days and weeks I would prefer to enjoy doing it to not burnout in my 20s/30s.Anyways thanks for any help or advice you could give I truly appreciate it.
hlxi4k	1593995112	745	**TL;DR: My work has unsustainable hours and expectations. I think I'm burning out, I don't know how much longer I can keep working like this, and have had my concerns dismissed by my boss and management. What should I do? How can I make my work schedule more manageable?**So I work for a tech company implementing SaaS software. As part of the the company's "covid response", the sales team was given permission to include "unlimited implementations" for all new sales. This means that once a client signs a sales deal, they get to book unlimited amounts of time on my calendar to guide them through the setup and configuration process of the software.As you can image, this new policy has wreaked absolute havoc on my work schedule, which was fine before this policy was put into place. Our department has these new KPIs for us in place:\- Everyone on the team is expected to have 4-5 1 hour sessions per day.\- It is mandatory to follow a "post session" admin process after each call. This involves updating a project plan, adding notes from the call, and updating the client after every session. Each "post-session" update also takes approximately 1 hour.  These updates have to have a start time, stop time, and be "posted" on our internal site within 24 hours of the call being endedTogether, the two conditions above already equal 8-10 hours of work per day, without any time for lunch or breaks. The contract I signed states I need to work for 8 hours per day.On top of these requirements, I also have to somehow find time in the day to:1. Answer emails from other clients who don't have a call booked that day (all email replies due within 24 hours of submission)  - usually takes 1-2 hours per day depending on volume2. Create support tickets for the support team, or requests for custom projects for the dev team on behalf of clients (if the client asks for this during a session) - usually takes 1-2 hour per day depending on volume3. Answer to anything and everything the CEO asks me or anyone on the team to do. The CEO is extremely hands on and will literally cancel my entire day's sessions with clients to work on their tasks instead. Examples include writing blog posts, working on support sessions, etc. My boss is constantly undermined and overruled by the CEO who takes matters in their own hands directly - another 1-2 hours per day.All 3 of these extra items are "due" the day of when they occur. As you can see, it is impossible to do any work early or optimize my schedule because it is entirely dependent on when the call with the client happens.In addition, whenever I do any sort of activity during the day - it could be sending an email, making a call, testing a configuration - a mandatory note has to be added to our internal system explaining what I did and how much time it took. This reporting process alone also adds countless amounts of time to the day.So, if you add all these activities up, at the low end it's a minimum of 11 hours per day, and often times more than that - 12, 14, 16 hour days have become the norm. It's been like this for the past 3 months and there are no signs of anything changing. I've asked my manager and department VP a few times for help managing my schedule, and have received responses such as "We need your cooperation in this difficult time" or "you manage your own schedule. Set your time accordingly" (obviously I don't have any control over my own schedule).On top of all of this, they also cut my pay by 15% for the past 3 months due to "Covid measures", even though they had a record sales month.I'm fed up at these hours, working literally double the number of hours per day compared to what was  stated in my contract, for 15% less than what I was originally making, and have received zero support from management to address these concerns.I absolutely want to leave ASAP but I know the job market is tough right now. What should I do? Just work less hours and let them fire me so I can collect unemployment? Or take a vacation and see if things change? I know deep down they won't though.Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks.
hk6bmd	1593726794	258	I am an incoming college student stuck between different options. Basically, my parents are going to make me go to med or law school, which I am fine with but I am really stuck in deciding what my focus should be. Option 1: MedicineI really love to work with my hands and it would be great to help others everyday, and I can see myself enjoying it. I just don’t feel good about not being in full control of choosing my specialty, where I go for residency, and potential burnout especially with so many yrs of training. I also feel inclined to go for more lucrative specialties even though I know you can’t go into medicine thinking about money. Not a huge fan of the core science-y stuff either (more interested in psych, poli sci, philosophy) but I love the idea of being able to open up and work with the human body and I’m super into that stuff. Option 2: Law/businessIf I went this route, I would probably do a joint MBA-JD degree because I am interested in finance and those degrees would give me a lot of career mobility and high earning potential. I don’t know what types of professions I could go straight into besides investment banking or private equity, it would be great if you guys gave me some ideas. I don’t like the idea of sitting in an office all day with no real hands on work, but I love working with numbers, making connections and decisions, etc.Please let me know what you think
hjyjwo	1593701960	384	**First I am gonna give a little background;**I am 26 years old, a Turkish citizen and a shipbuilding engineering bachelor from one of the most reputable universities in Turkey. Though I did not want to pursue that career back in the days, so I looked into modern more popular careers and were lucky to land a job in Digital Marketing back in 2018 ( Online Ads Management, Google Analytics Consultancy, Measurement etc.)But I was working in an agency and working hours led me to a burnout (was most of the times working on the weekends as well) thus I wanted to do something different. I applied to various masters and got accepted to one of the best MBA programs in Turkey with full scholarship.Now I graduated my MBA (it was a full-time 1-year program) and in the second semester I completed a project in PepsiCo where we did data visualization through Tableau software and our project selected as the top one.**Coming back to now;** It's hard to lend jobs on field without any experience these days, and I am not sure if I should go back to digital marketing or try to move in another field. In the last year I realized that I have interest in world economics, businesses and their strategic moves etc. and this led me thinking maybe I should pursue a career on fields such as business analyst, business development, strategy etc. but its nearly impossible to land those jobs for me because nearly all of them looks for experience.I know I can land a job in digital marketing, but since I have done an MBA I feel like I want to be on a path where I can grow into a managerial role, digital marketing jobs requires too much operational technical stuff and most of the times it bores me after a point. I want to be more social and active in my job as well, I prefer not to work in a position where I only do technical stuff and not use my social skills because I am an outgoing person and I have some ADHD thus I always look for social events and interactions. I am so confused about what to do actually haha.Sorry for the complicated post, I thank people who could stand reading haha!Thanks in advance!
hjg3oa	1593628481	199	Hi everyone, I've decided to take some time off my work because of burnout. And since everyone is quarantined I thought it would be a great time to learn a new useful skill that may be applied in different roles. I worked as a salesperson for an international company which I didn't not enjoy, and I'd like pursue a career in international organization, think tank or NGO. Or start my own thing in education since that's what I've been working in throughout my whole career. So the question is - what are some great skills that are fun, can be acquired somehow quickly (6 months-1 year) and applied in range of roles? Couple of things that came to my mind but I am really far from any of those so I am not sure how easy it would be for a novice to learn:* programming* business analytics* Photoshop* video editing* SMMI know those are like apples and oranges :D but I just need to pick something to keep my brain busy but also not waste the time for learning something I end up never using like 3 years of french I did in university. Oh, I am from Eastern Europe.
hj5d18	1593586909	223	Title is pretty straight forward but what are some tips people have used while WFH?I’ve been in quarantine since mid-March. My specific program at work has been short staffed since the quarantine. As a result since mid-March I’ve been working essentially two jobs. At first my introverted personality had me thriving, I was occupied and productive in my pajamas at home, who doesn’t want that? But now it’s July, and I’m starting to struggle. I work from an old, uncomfortable couch in my living room because I don’t have an office space, my back hurts all the time. I’m starting to find difficulties maintaining the work load. And motivation is going down the toilet. I’ve taken basically no time off because it simply wasn’t an option for me during Covid, as all my much older and immunocompromised colleagues were getting the PTO. I still can’t really take any time off, if I do there’s not much I can do as I’m stuck at home and I’m in the worst place in the US for covid right now (Arizona). I’ve done some field work during quarantine and this has helped break up the burn out but I don’t always have field work to do. The burnout is worse than I ever experienced pre-covid and I’m not sure how to improve my situation.What would you recommend?
hj52j0	1593585376	306	Hey guys, I'm a recent graduate who majored in biology but took some CS courses throughout college. Since I was in high school I've always thought I wanted to be a physician and my underlying reason for this was because I  am genuinely fascinated by the intimate physician-patient interaction and the whole process of figuring out a diagnosis and treatment plan. You also get to visually see an improvement in your patient's life because of your actions and that is a huge plus for me in terms of job satisfaction. While I understand there are numerous things wrong with the healthcare system such as burnout and outdated EHR software, I still think I would love my job because of the fact that I know I will be improving the lives of my patients. But maybe I'm also being extremely naive. The other part of me has this entrepreneurial spirit and when I discovered my interest in computer science during my freshman summer, I taught that it was the perfect combination for me to try to make the most impact I possibly can through technology. I'm mostly interested in health-tech and medical devices and I definitely want to one day have my own company. Also, while I think I would love medicine, I am a bit scared about what life will be like for me after residency, such that I'm afraid that I won't have time for hobbies, friends, and family. Sorry if this is too long but I'm really just wondering if anyone else has been in this dilemma between choosing a career in medicine and a career in technology. I'm really lost in terms of where to go from here. I can choose to study for the MCAT and apply to medical school or just focus on getting a Master's in CS and doing side-projects.
hj4yjq	1593584867	261	HelloI'm 21 years old male, i have no education yet besides school.First time i attended nuclear thermophysics, but dropped out 8 months later , because it was mediocre university and i felt that nuclear thermophysics and power station job is not really for me (i had no problems with studying there).Now my parents push me to attend to whatever university and learn whatever profession, no matter what because "it's too late and the time is ticking".Now i want to attend to faculty of mechanics and mathematics / computational mathematics and cybernetics in one of the top universities in my country, not only just for a diploma, but for professors, community and other resources. And I feel that if I will be trying to study all the heavy stuff, starting side projects etc. in mediocre university in addition to it's must-have work (classes etc.), i will quickly burnout and lose another 3-10 years, and mediocre university itself will be waste of time.Also i have some fears related to all of this: i fear that it's actually too late, that i've lost starting time and won't succeed in career or science or research etc. and because of this i'm not firmly convinced that other education/jobs field are not more suitable. Also my groupmates will be 18-19 years old, while i will be 21-22. Maybe these fears and thoughts are irrational and infantile, i don't know, but i'd appreciate if you give your advice/opinion on it.What should i do?Thanks in advance  And sorry for my English if it's bad, it's not my native language
henwtq	1592949177	539	I will do my best to keep it short, but I can't make any promises...I am a 26 year old male from Toronto, ON and I currently hold a BFA in Dance from a private liberal arts institution in NYC. I am looking to transition into the daunting world of finance/business. After years of hard work, determination, burnout, and quite honestly, and loss of passion, I am ready to move into something different. I am looking to return back to school for the Spring 2021or Fall 2021 semester. My problem is that I have absolutely no idea how to go about it. Is there anyone out there who has experienced a major career transition (particularly from the arts into something very different)? I'm sure many of you may suggest that I stay in Canada for many reasons, but I can't help but want to return to school in NYC again despite the astronomical cost of tuition/cost of living. Would it be recommended to pursue a second bachelor? I have learned that my BFA doesn't hold much value- some schools in Canada have asked me to complete high school courses to even apply (the Canadian vs US admission process), whereas I could submit a stronger application to American schools with LOR, personal statement etc. Should I try to take some prerequisites/certificate programs at a community college in Toronto to ease my way into the field? What I loved about my undergrad was that although I had a strong idea of what I wanted to go into (being dance), I was exposed to the many avenues of work aside from the performance route, such as dance admin/fundraising, physiotherapy, dance criticism etc. I worry that at my age I don't have the time or financial freedom to explore the different areas of business or even gain My resume is full of part-time jobs that allowed me to work on my craft and nothing related to business at all. I don't have a natural taking to math by any means. I am the type of person who is "good" at most things but haven't quite found where I belong after quitting dance. I attribute my work ethic to my years of vigorous dance training and most likely years of disapproval from my father.I currently have an admissions offer to NYU to pursue my MA in Food Studies, which seems intriguing to me, but not something that I am super passionate about, nor do it see it leading in the direction of job security.I haven't felt such a strong desire to change in quite some time. I feel ready to embark on a new journey and face new challenges. I'm not sure if the Universe has just brought all of these thoughts to the forefront of my mind, or if COVID has only exacerbated my regrets on not double majoring in college, or perhaps it's feeling exhausted from only working minimum wage jobs. I'm not sure what it is exactly, but I am eager to provide the life I want for myself! I would love to hear from anyone who has experienced this sort of shift/who has an education in both Canada &amp; US/school recommendations in the Northeast. Any advice or input is greatly appreciated!
hccnzf	1592614079	152	It is time to go, that I know. I waffle constantly in between being so disengaged I pray to be fired,  being anxiety ridden by the fear of being fired, or basking in the glow of the thought of walking out the door. I've vocalized that portfolios need resources if returns are expected, but there is no relief to this perennial hiring freeze in sight.I don't have the will or energy to give it another real go (this week I barely got through the 9-5, and I took 2 weeks of burnout leave in Feb ), and while I am looking for work, my energy and mood is so low I'm not terribly productive.So, quit, wait to be fired (I've fielded a few subtle criticisms of my performance of late from a new boss) or somehow stay sane till an alternative is found (if stay sane, how)?Thanks for all feedback / advice!
hbboc1	1592473971	85	I graduated 2 years ago with a major in marketing, and started working immediately after college as a copywriter for an ad agency. The work was fine, but it was very demanding in terms of the hours I put in, which resulted in a burnout so I quit. I don't think I want to continue in the Advertising industry anymore, and I'm gravitating more towards journalism cuz I've always wanted to become a journalist. What options do I have and what should I ideally do next?

h9ekw1	1592220935	658	I'm  the introspective and analytic guy so, sometimes, I like to do my job  alone, without the interference of others, and sometimes, when I  interact with people, at the end of the day I feel exhausted.I  work in a digital agency for a little more than three years. In the last year, before became de leader of my team, I've been the employee  who worked a shift of 12 hours long, but I loved of what I was doing,  taking care of 12 clients and my job was mostly hands on, without so  many meetings. Recently I became the coordinator of my team, so I have  to take care of 7 people, plus over 50 clients. And since the beginning  of the year all I'm doing now is doing meetings with current and new  clients, leaving my team aside. I feel responsible for a lot of mistakes  they've been doing, since I can't take a closer look at them because of  all these meetings. Sometimes these meetings start at 9 a.m. and end 9  p.m., one after another, lunch in front of the PC was really common (or  not eating at all). Besides that, I've been disliking the way the  company is being managed, since a new COO is in charge.My  worst breakdown came when I was talking with my new employee, showing  to him a few things about the company, and seeing the messages in my  whastapp, skype and e-mail coming up all at once, feeling really  overwhelmed. When I finished speaking with this new employee, I called  to a fried of mine and started to cry a lot.Besides  all that the corona virus situation makes me feel bad too. I've been  fearful that I contract this and let my parents sick too (both 70+). So  I'm really concerned with them, while them don't believe in anything of  what's happening.For the past 30 days I'm having a breakdown, so working is being really difficult. For these past days I'm feeling:* restless* heavy chest* couldn't sleep (or sleeping really late so I could enjoy more time away from work)* I woke a lot of times feeling down and wanting to cry* crying really, really easily* questioning about my work and myself* isolating myself* easily forgetting any information* walking up and down in my house with a blank mind, feeling anxiousI  asked for a vacation so I could rest a little, hoping that I could feel  better. I even disabled any notifications from my whatsapp so I could rest and don't think about them. But I'm in the last day of my vacation and can’t see an end to feeling this way. I've been thinking about changing careers too, so I don't have to speak with clients.I  tried to speak with the CEO and the COO about that, but all they did  was opening an excel table, write down a few solutions (none of them was good) and asking for me for a solution. There was no empathy to my feelings.I don't know what this feeling is (burnout maybe?) and I don't know what to do. Should I quit my job and rest for a while? Should I change my career to another one that I don't need to talk with clients? Is there any other way to handle this?Recently I started getting a psychological support, but still this feeling doesn't go away.Ps: Sorry for my English, it's not my first language.TL;DR:  I'm really introspective and I think because of my job as a team coordinator, having to talk to a lot of clients, going through a lot of  stressful situations (like averting cancellations), it's making me feel really down about my work and myself lately, and I don't know what to do or how make this feeling go away.
h7q3wp	1591986078	149	Let me preface by saying i am incredibly fortunate to still have a job. I also recognize I need to take care of my mental health.I’ve been at a startup for a little over a year and I think I hit a wall.I was really excited for the hustle and wearing a ton of different hats. My workload has increased as we’ve had to pivot so much with COVID, but the stress of struggling fundraising our Seed round and no basic benefits (only unlimited PTO but taking it is more work than not) is getting to me. Pay of course is relatively low for where I’m at, and with no fundraising money, I’m not sure if/when we’ll get a promotion or benefits.Should I chalk it up to just burnt out (especially given the external climate of the world), or should I cut my losses and start looking for another job?

h0lkk3	1591827067	616	Hey all, I'm looking to try and commit to a career path as part of a recent decision to pivot out of the library world, where I've enjoyed great success but haven't found much to challenge myself or build into a long-term plan. I have a lot of experience in various fields of customer service and excel in tasks where I can either single-mindedly devote myself to a task or find solutions to a set of more minor issues. I don't mind physical or emotional labor, as with most work, find it very difficult to be devoted to unless it feels like I'm really helping someone or accomplishing an immediate benefit. I guess what I'm saying there is I need to see purpose in my work, and profits/other abstracts don't motivate me, helping people does. Spent a good bit of time in the retail sector and just found that I really could not care less about making a sale, unless I really think the customer would benefit. That's part of what I like about the library- I'm not selling, I'm recommending, and above all, giving. Giving access to art, stories, community resources, all that. It feels like I'm helping and also encouraging creativity and that's a total vibe. Nothing feels better to me than suggesting a book, comic, or album to someone and having them come back and be able to share my love for it. I've also always excelled in communication, whether that's empathizing with someone, expressing a point, reasoning out a solution between people, etc. Throughout my life I've done a lot of hobby work as a writer but don't think I'm to the point that I could survive being a novelist alone, as self-publishing includes a lot of marketing strategy that I don't have the interest in to succeed at. So, in a short list:* I want to help people. * I have a developed skillset and experience in communication, whether written or verbal. * I'm not motivated by profits- I'm motivated by helping individuals.* Creative work and positions requiring empathy are areas where I think I'd excel. Some jobs I've been considering:1. Story Editor- An editor for creative works where I would help more with macro-level plot and character arcs, expressing themes, etc. What really appeals to me about this is being able to help other authors refine their vision to the point it's the best it can possibly be. I'm not as interested in the line-by-line grammatical side of things, but I see the necessity of these as brushstrokes in the larger painting.  1. Therapist- Something that's been recommended to me before, as I am a good listener and genuinely want to help people however I can. What I worry about here is burnout from not being able to render immediate aid and instead just helping people cope with things that last lifetimes. It's a worthy service, but I don't view myself as someone who has the answers to life, and people come to therapists looking for answers or help. I wouldn't want to let people down by not being able to do that, and I wouldn't want to collapse under the pressure of such insurmountable obstacles. 1. Social work- This one I'm mostly considering as a category rather than any specific role. I like the aspect of my current job where I'm working with the government in a role specifically meant to aid and provide for communities, and being able to do that with bigger issues sounds very fulfilling. My biggest concern here is that the process would be too abstracted for me to stay invested in, and I'd burn out and be crushed by the boot heels of bureaucracy.
h06p0f	1591777514	94	Recently, I quit my job as a software engineer amidst some pretty big burnout. I've been lucky in that I can afford to take an unpaid break for awhile. I assumed after I took some time off, I would be ready to jump back in, but I can't seem to get myself motivated to go back to software engineering. Can anyone suggest any careers that I could potentially switch over to? I've considered the obvious ones like product or project management, but those are a little too closely related to what I've done. Any thoughts?
gzo2hr	1591712454	676	First off, I apologize in advance for the length of this post. I’m hoping this will be gently received.I’m a 23-year-old female (Toronto). Since my childhood I’ve been extremely passionate about becoming a physician. I love science and helping people, but I also love piecing together puzzles and finding solutions for things, so it seemed like a perfect match for me. I was also always a slightly anxious person. My parents convinced me that a good way to prepare myself for a career in medicine was to go to nursing school.I enjoyed my classes and graduated at the top of my class, but I found that my experiences with clinical placements were overall unpleasant. I was disgusted by the poor conditions for patients and workers. I learned I didn’t enjoy the hands-on part of caring for patients and didn’t feel like my work had made a long-term difference for them, especially when I was faced with disrespectful behaviour. I connected emotionally with patients and received positive feedback about my bedside manner, but I can be timid and found myself overwhelmed and drained by the constant interactions with patients and staff. Most of my learning experience was in bedside nursing, so while it might be a result of my limited range of experience, it seems maybe nursing is not for me.I started seeing a therapist. The therapist said that I am introspective, came into therapy for the first time with a strong grasp of coping techniques, and that I have made a huge effort with my therapy. However, she admitted that I have generalized anxiety disorder that has been very resistant to therapy. I earned my Bachelor of Science in Nursing in 2019 and decided that since I was successful academically, had enjoyed the science and the analytical components of nursing, and had taken the appropriate pre-application steps for medical schools (e.g. volunteering), I wanted to continue to pursue my original dream. Unfortunately, between how I felt during nursing clinicals and the stress, worry, and self-doubt of applying to medicine, my anxiety has really gotten to me and is far worse than when I was even in school. I feel so many doubts about the application process, as well as whether I can mentally and emotionally handle med school if I were to actually get in. I’m aware of the stress, burnout, and suicide rates for physicians, and I don’t want to fail or worse. I sense I’m not thinking clearly and objectively about my future. I can’t tell whether my suddenly mixed feelings about medicine are an outcome of becoming more aware of my limitations, or simply a result of the anxiety, as I’m also terrified to get a nursing job.I want a career I enjoy and am skilled at, one that is respected in society, and where I can help make a real difference, but I would also like to earn decent money. Ideally, I would like a career where I can work long and hard and eventually make six figures. I’d prefer not to do another undergrad and to use my current degree, perhaps just taking it in another direction or getting a higher level of education. I enjoy teaching and health promotion. I’m looking at masters programs involving public health and epidemiology, health\[care\] policy and/or law school, but I don’t want to take a program where I might end up miserable or with poor employment opportunities.I’m open to all suggestions, even outside of healthcare. If it helps, my Myers-Briggs personality type is INFJ. My strongest subjects in school were anything that involved bio, psych, sociology, writing, software, or music. Weakest subjects were chem and math, but I can do well with some extra time investment.TL;DR I’m a new RN, a naturally anxious person and felt out of place with bedside nursing. Wanted to become a physician, but been recently having doubts about my ability to succeed; was told by a therapist I have generalized anxiety disorder. Scared to get a nursing job and would love suggestions for alternative career(s) (in or out of healthcare).
gzk2pw	1591696535	181	I completed school last year. Graduated with an engineering degree + a Master's in Liberal arts and started working as an education manager. So far, I've been struggling with everything. I have a 6 day workweek, putting in 9 hours everyday. At 24, I have absolutely no personal time to pursue the things I want (primarily further education). My company has somehow found its way around labour laws and the sales team is even more overworked. I complete a year in July, and I've never been more depressed. I am not fond of what I do at all - I'm a super introvert and my job requires to coach students of my age for higher education. The whole business and ethics of higher education baffles me. More than being overworked, I'm constantly conflicted with the amount of corruption and unethical institutions (even big Education giants and institutions) in my industry. I don't want to struggle anymore. Can anyone share their experiences within the education industry and/or how they moved into a more morally lucrative role? I don't even care about money anymore.
gyyc4j	1591619032	815	Firstly, I'll just preface this post by saying that I KNOW I'm lucky to have kept my job during COVID. I'm aware that many people have lost their jobs because of the pandemic and been forced into difficult situations (and my heart goes out to them). However, I hope it can be taken into account that many of us are struggling in many different ways right now.Without getting into too much detail, I've been extremely unhappy with my job for some time now and was planning on leaving until COVID happened. I'm a copywriter at a marketing company. I honestly hate sales and marketing writing. I also now feel stuck and like I can't plan a proper exit strategy. I'm currently experiencing total employee burnout and my performance is really starting to slip. I haven't slept at all in the past night and this happens regularly. I'm also not eating properly and am just dealing with anxiety, depression and fatigue. I can hardly think or focus on anything.However, my general feelings about this really aren't a result of what's happened with COVID. I've honestly been feeling this way for quite a long time now. My company's current work from home setup has not improved any of this, but even pre-COVID my company was very poorly managed, with a lot of inexperienced people running the show and an extreme lack of organization. There's a lot of trite, stupid stuff the company forces everyone to do to try to "make sure we work as a team". There are constant, excessive amounts of hour-long, sometimes two hour-long meetings (with an increased frequency during our current WFH setup), where nobody contributes anything valuable to a conversation and where I get the sense that they're only arranged so that managers feel relevant. There's a whooole lot of office politics and people getting their own way by kissing up to the right people. It's all so repulsive, fake and so many of these processes just take away from my productivity.As someone who is by nature quite introverted and who greatly dislikes having to navigate through annoying people problems, constantly having to tread around the politics, put on a face and play a game every week has become so mentally draining. And that's not even on top of all the work I have. It's a regular occurrence that I work MANY extra hours on top of my regular ones, all of which I'm not paid for. Before we started WFH, I'd regularly stay at the office until 8, sometimes 9pm trying to get work done. Now, I just keep working and don't turn my computer off until late hours in the day.I've had several people tell me I should find a better job and that my current company isn't run well, but I honestly fear that every office job is like this. That every office job will involve having to say things that you wouldn't normally say to people for 8 hours a day, having to participate in pretentious, vapid and unproductive meetings for the sake of making the more ego-driven staff feel important, having to listen to coworkers talk more about other people than the work itself, being constantly distracted, having to tread on eggshells, etc. I know many have probably said something of the like before me, but it just seems like there should be so much more to life than this. I see other people at my company who seem so excited about the culture, who seem so personable and like they fit into it so well, and I can't help but wonder... is it just me who sees through all of this, or are they just better actors than I am?I'm a writer and an artist and as much as I am preparing to hear answers such as "this is life", "most people have to deal with this to get by financially" and "you won't make any money and will struggle taking an alternative route", I really can't fathom the idea of spending another 10 years of my life dealing with office culture and putting my time and energy into a climate I despise so much. I really want to value myself, my talents and my life more than this. I really don't want to live anymore if this is all there is to life.Does anyone have a story they can share about how they transitioned out of this lifestyle and took on a job that allowed them more time to work on their creative pursuits? Such as working at a coffee shop, restaurant or something where you can clock in/clock out a little more easily? I know taking a pay cut is inevitable, but I want to explore the possibility of actually living a lifestyle that will make me happier. Feedback is welcome, and I apologize if this is lengthy and if any of this doesn't sound realistic.
gyh86e	1591553422	333	Thought I might find some other tired academics here. Experiencing burnout fast, and though I've considered the PhD more times than I can count, enough friends who've gone that route have warned me it's not paying off. I'm noticing my own age, and I know the sacrifices higher ed demands won't be sustainable forever. I love working by myself, one-on-one, and in small groups, but my anxiety was regularly in overdrive teaching larger classes.I have two terminal degrees with honors from reputable programs, one in writing and the other in religion. Most of my professional experience has been in teaching and editing, always within a higher ed setting. I've also worked in a human rights office for a metropolitan government, in ministry and as a chaplain. I have some leadership experience from being elected to chair academic orgs and I've also worked on policy committees for a major university.My career path began because I was interested in the unique relationships with religion members of marginalized communities have, and active listening/offering counsel to people is probably a natural aptitude I've strengthened through practice. Reading and writing are my most enduring passions, though, and the pipe dream--if I could choose anything--would be living as a reclusive writer. I feel at a crossroads, realizing security matters more than when I was young and idealistic \[and is tied to morale\], and I'd love some help brainstorming next steps. My understanding is that the blessing/curse of arts and humanities degrees is that they're so flexible, but with most job stuff going online these days and job titles seeming super specific, I have no idea where to begin searching. If there are adjacent careers where I could boost my salary through certification, etc. I'd be happy to consider. Feel free to tell me if I've got it wrong about PhDs and higher ed prospects. **TL;DR:** Religion scholar and writer with teaching, editing and ministry experience looking to shift out of academia to a more secure area, leaning on storytelling/writing/editing/counseling/leadership strengths.
gw6xjz	1591232343	302	I am 31 years old and have a BA in Sociology.  I have been working for 7 years at a company in the operations department handling the international shipments and logistics. I don’t really care about my job at all but the pay is decent (about $50k) I’ve been thinking of becoming a teacher but in addition to taking a $9k paycut, I’m not sure if I will actually like teaching. I used to work in a daycare for a year and although I loved the kids, I do remember being tired all the time. And I wasn’t great at classroom management. I’m also pretty introverted even though I really love little kids. I’ve also been reading a lot of horror stories about how teaching is mostly behavior management and lots of bureaucracy. It seems that many teachers leave after 5 years or so. Also, looking at the salary schedule, it will take me almost 10 years to make $50k again as a teacher. I am a really analytical person and I love learning. Sometimes I can’t tell if I want to be a teacher most because I want to be in school.  I have taken a few computer programming classes and I’m pretty good at it but I don’t know enough to actually do anything and  not sure if I care enough about technology to have a full career in it.  I don’t really know what to do but I want to make a smart decision. Any advice on teaching or IT as careers? I don’t need to have a big fancy career and I’d like to be a mom in the near future, but I also don’t necessarily want to go backwards in pay just to end up in a job that So many people burnout in.
gry6p8	1590634917	523	27m IT graduate living in Australia. I did really well at school and made dux (valedictorian for those in the States), but at college I become a dispassionate and aimless burnout. I jumped from degree to degree until I settled on IT. In my final year I realised that I hated my course but I was so sick of changing that I eventually just decided to bear it and graduate. A degree is better than dropping out, at least I thought. Except it didn't properly prepare me for an IT career, and most of the programming job postings were for languages I didn't know. So it was hard getting work and for the next 4 years I was basically working a bunch of different casual/ temp Admin roles until I lost my recent job due to Covid. Not that I cared much because it was only a very basic casual role. But now I don't know what to do with my career. I'm considering reeducation but have no idea where to go. Here's some possible options I've been thinking of:* Do a masters in Cyber Security or Data Analytics. The markets good and the jobs pay well, but like I said before I hated studying IT.* Do a career change postgrad. There are Masters and diploma courses that only require a Ba in any field. Right now I've been considering Environmental Management, Agriculture or Urban Planning.* Do a career change in community college (TAFE). I was possibly considering horticulture.* Keep looking for work with my useless degreeTime and money are a problem too, and though money isn't a problem now I'd probably prefer any solution that got me working ASAP. Problem is there is very little in terms of careers that I'm passionate about. I only picked out those masters in particular because I thought they would be government work that is helpful to the community. I'm not really interested in the subjects. Right now I just want to escape this depressing situation I am in and get direction and structure to my life. I want to find or work towards a job that:* Has a great work life balance* Is not detrimental to physical health (like working in a cubicle all day)* Is something that is interesting or makes me feel fulfilled doing (helping the community/environment)* Has decent pay (doesn't have to be high just decent)Any suggestions would be appreciated. Even though I said I was living in Australia, please still put in your input if you're international, as any advice is good advice and I need all the help I can get. As to what I'm actually interested in (if it helps), I'm passionate about my health/fitness. Though I could never make it as a personal trainer, and it would take 4 years full-time studying to become a Nutritionist or Physio. I always wanted to do a degree in Arts/ the humanities (particularly Sociology, Philosophy, Political Science and Theology) but there isn't really a solid career at the end (plus its 3-4 years full time as well).Thanks for taking the time to read this, and like I said any help is appreciated.

gob3xa	1590115779	674	Late 20s, I have a BS in Mathematics. Started coding in 2009. I've had two primary jobs over the course of my professional life, and both revolved around:1. Identifying a need in a company for a software solution2. Learning what I needed to learn to deliver said software solution3. Putting together and teaching a squad to help me code and support things I am not what I would consider a professional software engineer. This is not imposter syndrome, as I believe I will be a damn good software engineer or dev team manager, but the title of "engineer" is a little strong *right now*. I'd say I'm an amateur software guy who gets paid 65% of what an engineer would get paid. I learn what I need to learn, I'm an expert in nothing. I can't say a lot about best practices except what i've thrown together in my attempt at building an agile/scrum team (two buzzwords I learned two years ago).I'm sick of corporate life. I'm sick of the rat race, the politics, the awards and recognition going to the managers. I'm sick of feeling like someone "playing" software engineer. I'm sick of knowing enough to be dangerous and nothing more. I'm sick of having a good paying, soul sucking corporate experience.I want a break. I want to spend time, nose to the grind stone, just learning things and formalizing my knowledge and focusing on myself. I want to work towards being a real software engineer, or at least real content with life for the first time since university.So there I was, ready to quit. I had enough savings for some months of unemployment if I'm frugal, and I always am. I'd start with a 3 day hike in a nearby forest and then when I got back, I'd spend 6 to 12 months focusing on me, learning, deciding if the next chapter involved graduate school in computer science or maybe a software engineering role in industry or even freelance coding while I get some road trips in. Maybe a combo of these things.And then COVID happened. "No big deal," I said, "I'll work from home, I'll save money, I'll wait it out." Well, it's been about 3 months of working from home. My job stress and my job dissatisfaction and my corporate dissatisfaction have only gotten predictably worse. I actually love quarantine but I hate everything between 8AM and 5PM. I'm so done. My heart, soul, and mind are done. I had to work incredibly hard to get my dev team to its current state, and now I barely get anything done at all because I am at max burnout. Sticking around as it's the responsible thing to do, it just isn't cutting it for me anymore.So I'm back to being ready to quit. I am 100% ready to turn in a notice and start planning my unemployment. But I also feel like quitting without something lined up is the dumbest thing I could do right now. I know what I want to do next with my life, but I also know that my path there is the picture of irresponsible behavior, and thus I am afraid to pull the trigger. I've never struggled to find a job because I've been lucky. This job market could be one of the worst in a very, very long time. So in that regard, I don't even know what I'm signing up for, if I'm being honest.Some might say "just do your studying while not at work, search for jobs while not at work".  I am not someone who can be soul-crushed 8am to 5pm in my career and then work 6pm to 10pm on my career advancement. Sorry, can't do it, I've tried, I hated myself, can't do it.My safety net consists of months worth of savings and a loving family that will take me in if everything falls apart and I fall flat on my face for months and months on end.Am I on track to make a terrible choice, all things considered?
go66ac	1590098046	225	I have worked as hairstylist for the last ten years after a spotty attempt at an art degree.When I started doing hair, I had hoped on making it a fallback, recession-proof side job (I, unfortunately, graduated high school in 2008).I most recently completed a year of classes at community college focusing on UX design, psychology, and web programming and I’ve excelled in all of my classes and projects.I absolutely do not want to do hair anymore. I am an INTP. I do not like chit chat and I loathe touching people. Working in a space with several conversations and loud music was causing me daily burnout and I don’t feel I’m exercising my intellect, which makes me feel depressed. Since the Covid-19 outbreak- I now find my industry unsafe and even more horribly superficial. I feel the most excitement when I’m learning, researching, theorizing, and writing. I plan on finishing my undergrad and getting my masters, but in the mean time I just don’t think I can tolerate the hair industry. I have a barely-there ux/programming portfolio, an art portfolio, graphic design and visual communication skills, writing skills, a partially completed degree from community college, and my experience as a professional stylist. What do I do with all of that? Will I still be able to make $25-$30 an hour starting out on a new path?

go1j54	1590083279	33	I need some tips. I'm trying to manage my time but I seem to always need to work longer hours to get everything done. If everything is urgent, how can it be prioritized?Thank you
gnwhpo	1590066313	128	Hello everyone,I apologize in advance if this is better suited in another place. I have been in college for 5 years and am enrolled in an accelerated program where I finish my B.A. and start my Masters a the same time. I have also been working one (sometimes more) job, volunteering, and been involved on both campuses the whole time. I love school, but I am fried. I have also been in food service for about 10 years (since  I was 14) and been burnt out in that sector as well. Right now with the pandemic is not the best time to take time off from school; I also attend on scholarship. Does anyone have any advice for dealing with burnout and becoming passionate about the work again?
glex57	1589720003	335	I work as in-house counsel for a large MNC. The job is stressful, requires long hours, and is mind-numbingly dull. I actually don't mind the first of those two - I'm fine with managing stress and don't mind the late nights, but this only applies when the work is interesting. Which leads me to the breaking point - the constant boredom. The job is a never-ending stream of increasingly tedious and pedantic minutiae. I once had a high tolerance to this, but it has been slowly eroding away over time, and with it, my sanity. I'm looking for suggestions on what options I could realistically consider if I wanted to change careers. I'm not looking to rush into this change by any means, especially considering the current economic climate - and in any case, I think I've got a couple of years until the burnout properly kicks in. Any and all suggestions would be welcome - I am open to considering pretty much anything, and ideally something (1) intellectually stimulating, (2) not in the legal field, and (3) which I could easily transition into (i.e. which wouldn't require extensive retraining or going back to school).Some other information that may be helpful:* I'm 26F, I've been in this job for around 5 years, and this was my first job out of university.* I currently earn around £89,000 p/a. I would prefer a job that paid similarly, but I would definitely consider a pay-cut for the right role. * I'd say I have strong research and analytical skills. I can communicate effectively, and am largely good with people. I consider myself to be a balance of extraverted and introverted, but would lean towards the latter if asked to choose. I'm not good at anything that involves using my hands.  I would likely struggle in a creative field, and my maths skills are passable at best.Thanks to anyone taking the time to read this - I would be most grateful for any suggestions on what to consider here!
gkvc8o	1589638596	415	 Hey everyone, this is a throw-away account because some people might recognize my situation. I live in Europe and I am a full-time student.At the beginning of this year I got a part-time job which I am really grateful for taking into consideration the situation right now. We agreed on 16 hours per week (with 2 fixed days) because I need to balance my studies with work. Note that this is an office job so I could not work during weekends (thus it means that I had to skip schools days). During the interview they said this job should take 16-24 hours per week.Everything was great and the pay was good as well. However, in the past month the volume of work increased a lot and I hardly managed to finish all in 2 days and I even had to come to the office outside the working days because sometimes my job requires a physical presence + working from home during weekends to catch up.I started having burnout symptoms since I also have a lot of deadlines with school and I also feel stupid because the culture in this country is that if you do overtime you're not efficient. However, at my previous company (which was American) I managed to finish everything on time because it was way more structured and organized. Here I am being told 1 day in advance that the next day I need to be at the office (which will overlap with my lectures).I cannot say no since they are really nice and satisfied with me + I need to have my contract renewed soon. I can't go to another company because I am still a student and I need the money. I do not want to ask for money for the overtime I did or tell them that I need 8 extra hours per week to do my job at a normal pace since it would not be nice taking into consideration the fact that all companies lost a lot of money now / or that all my fellow students lost their job. But at the same time I hate my current lifestyle with almost no sleep.I thought about telling them that I want these extra hours as "days off" sometime in few months since I planned to have a vacation, but I do not know how to bring this up to them in a way that doesn't sound unprofessional. Do you have any advice for me, please?Thanks a lot!!
gksefk	1589624330	1702	Hi,So I've got multiple things on my mind about my current employer and personal situation that I probably need a very **objective and validated opinion** * **(1) on my workplace (especially about the severity of toxicity) and** * **on (2) the fact that should I quit now (3 months notice where I'm from) even while not having a job lined up yet or wait until I have a new one for career reasons (am I too fearful?)**First thing off, I'm suffering from my 3rd depression in quick succession (every 2-3 months a new one). The first one was triggered due to stress from the job. I'm completely open and am already receiving help from a therapist and also my friends are very supportive. Secondly, I'm contemplating about leaving my toxic workplace without yet having found a job because it had considerably affected my health the past 5 months (elevated blood pressure - back to normal now, heart palpitations - back to normal now, the only thing bothering me now is waking up too early due to unbalanced brain chemistry). The workplace (a smaller company of about 40 employees in the consulting industry) has had 40% - 50% y/y turn-over for years.  I've started there as an intern fresh out of university 3 years ago. I was (and still am to some sort) very ambitious and talented in wanting to making an impact on the tasks and responsibilities handed over to me as well as that the office is conveniently located 5 minutes from where I live - so I decided to stay there. I actually was quite successful in doing so by building up a critical sales-support/center-of-excellence function - firstly stemming from the fact that I was promoted regularly every year from intern, associate, lead, to manager (with team-lead responsibilities), while also being honored multiple times as transformation example for the company.  I've also applied myself and invested lots of energy in creating an open, supportive, inspiring, humorous and "can-do" attitude and way of working with the teams and people around me - especially given my perception on the toxicity und incapabilities rippling through the company coming directly from the psychopathic CEO/Owner and subsequently management. Unfortunately, this has been the only workplace I've been at - so while I know it's toxic, I just need perspective to understand the severity to help me with my decision to quit.&amp;#x200B;My first and hardest depression started in November, escalated over new-year until February, and finally resolved through open and almost honest conversations directly with the CEO, as my ex-boss (though kind and nice but incapable) didn't have the emotional energy herself after the strenuous period she, others and I went through at that time. During that time* I worked harder than before and directly with the partners still remaining to make sure we would reach overambitious company sales targets after 1/3 of the commercial team left during summer (which we achieved). In terms of workload, I was already handling 2x-3x what my other colleagues would.* I worked with a Partner, who was - in my opinion - on the verge of a burnout himself. Working with him during that period was extremely stressful for all team members as he was completely disorganized, unavailable, and non-responsive. On top of that, we had many opportunities that involved him and that I had to push through the commercial process - while not allowed to have access/escalate to the CEO as the ultimate decision-maker in many instances. My ex-boss was and still is completely overworked and was not being able to relay my escalation messages to the CEO (the company is overly complicated in terms of organization and R&amp;R's). That situation still remains as of today and is extremely frustrating as it's totally killing my productivity and causing unnecessary stress.* I was given additional workload absolutely outside my roles to support dysfunctional teams who wouldn't make progress - while clearly stating that this was too much (at least they took me out of it pretty quickly again)* I was simultaneously responsible for the process and supporting my ex-boss in setting up a bi-annual 3-day company event in December with workshops and everything around that, and had flagged early on that preparations were in delay, top-mgmt. was not doing their job in providing guidance, sign-offs or actually providing the content etc.    * As the 3-day event started in December, I was already completely drained-out, working days of 14hours (except weekends) had been routine over the last 2 weeks given my other high-workload responsibilities    * Things finally escalated for me, when my boss started to break down and cry at the end of "day 1", as she just didn't have the energy left to remind top-mgmt about open items and their to-do's they had been slacking off entirely the past 3 months. She is the first employee of the company and most precious darling of the CEO made him explode. He then violently started screaming and blaming me, for not having managed the process well - at least my boss came back and shouted back, that the least to blame was me, who had done everything to support her, and that it was the CEO and top-mgmt. themselves who were responsible for that mess.   * I thought I had seen it all by then. What totally brought me over the edge to the point of no return was then on the evening of "day 2", said previously mentioned partner jokingly and drunkenly started talking with me and then projected onto me "I have only one more week before Christmas to totally burn you out". &amp;#x200B;In the meantime, I burned out, experienced PTSD, strong depression (I'm an endurance athlete and I couldn't even go for long walks anymore without feeling that I'm going to just break down on the spot, I underwent MRI, cardio and heart-tests, and am now in therapy). I took 2 week of sick days to recover from that traumatic experience. I then took all my courage and guts to get back to work. The reason I did this was: * to get my promotion in February - which in terms of responsibilities I had already gotten back in Autumn but where they didn't want to give me a promotion yet. * ask for a considerable salary raise (they already pay 10% less than the market). My new current boss was open but my emotionally unavailable ex-boss totally escalated the situation again to the CEO where I was then bullied to back down and excuse myself for my behavior. This + a heartbreak in my personal life sent me straight down my 2nd depression. * prove myself I can overcome those challenges and thus get my self-confidence back. I ended up experiencing lots of personal growth in those moments. I sought open discussions with everyone who had hurt me - they were incredibly hard from point of view but ultimately led me to experiencing lots of personal growth . &amp;#x200B;This leads me to my current situation, where I'm now hitting my 3rd (light) depression, still working at that company and actively seeking new jobs since already 1 month* I'm having low self-confidence, self-efficacy, and a semi-identity crisis (i.e. realization that I'm still missing lots of skills that I thought I had or actually once had such as regression of communication skills and social intelligence). * I haven't accomplished anything meaningful in the past 3 months at work. I  might be leading a team of one now, we're trying to build up a new center of excellence function along the customer to replicate the success story I was able to deliver in the past, I'm still delivering on the core responsibilities of my old function.  On the other hand* Nonetheless, I'm walking around in a negative mindset and in self-doubt over my capabilities, motivations, values, interests, and skills.  I completely messed up an interview this week on a job I really wanted. After that, a lot of my (Ex-) colleagues have offered me coaching which I'm now accepting and regaining confidence in my abilities. * Thanks to COVID and Home-Office, I'm able to withhold lots of my performance towards the company and re-directing that energy in furthering other aspects of my life. In comparison to work, I've achieved an incredible amount of change and on the trajectory of self-growth in most of my other personal life dimensions)Alas, the CEO is still a psychopath, and most of the leadership team has been groomed to unquestionably follow him. I've gained assertiveness in politely expressing my boundaries towards work, my boss, and also influence my ex-boss. This is due to the fact, * that they have cut salaries now by 10% due to COVID, * started to scheduled meetings after-works (from 6-10pm) hours almost every day* and the last transgression was the CEO now creating Whatsapp groups on my personal phone number for proposals due in 1 to 4 day, instead of using official company-wide communication channels - how am I supposed to shut-off work?However this retaliation of mine meets resistance by my boss and ex-boss, both groomed and scared by the CEO. I get told to fall in line and accept it as it is - these are tough times, driven people who want to achieve.  So, in the end, after this long story, what **I'm probably looking for is an experience and outside perspective in how much was I either (A) just not able to deal with the requirements of the work place, (B) I should have grown-up and left a long time ago, no matter my advancement in career due to this being a truly toxic environment, and/or (C)  that extra push/confirmation, that it is indeed the right action to leave now - even without a job - and rebuild myself where with a more positive mindset, I'll be able to land the next job/interview.**Any elaborate opinion is very welcome in these times.&amp;#x200B;In a way, I'm considering thisattempt to concisely synthesizing my recent experience as a further therapeutic approach to deal with what has happened to me, besides talking this through with friends, and a professional
gjc50s	1589418240	338	Background: I am a couple months into a new job that I'm really passionate about, I never thought I'd nail down a job so related to my interests. I carry a lot of anxiety around doing a good job and making sure my employer doesn't regret hiring me.Anyways, I've come to realize we will be working with a well-known local NGO I tried volunteering with on two occasions about 5 years ago. Keyword: tried. When I first took on some volunteer work with them I was in the middle of finishing off an intense school program and bit off more than I could chew. I regretfully had to bow out of the work. They seemed understanding. Months later, I finished school and started a new job that wasn't quite in line with my career goals. I was still keen to get some relevant experience under my belt and reached out to this organization again if I could support them in some way. Once again, I started feeling overwhelmed (later learned this was due to burnout and untreated mental health issues) and informed the company that I didn't think I could finish the work. The communications quickly fizzled out (don't remember them even responding) and that was that.I'm someone that takes a lot of pride in my work ethic and I know this part of my past reflects poorly on me. I'm very ashamed of it. I am afraid when I eventually meet these people again they will have a pre-determined judgement of me (which I can't blame them for). Worst case, which I know is highly unlikely, they mention how much I suck to my new boss and colleagues. I'm also not sure how to navigate the initial re-meeting with them. Will they even remember me? I'm sure there will be some vague familiarity. What do I say? *"Hey, remember me? I'm that girl who couldn't complete any work for you!"* I am not the most socially savvy person and would really appreciate advice on how to handle this.
gfw4mc	1588954664	645	Hi everyone, New to this page. A bit about myself, 21F, studying a university bridging program, and just overall confused with where I want to go. I get so many different opinions from relatives and friends regarding what I would be good at, but I wanted to ask people who have some sort of experience with this. Now, I wanted to mention that I do have mental health issues to address; I'm a highly sensitive person who is pretty introverted/reclusive. I always enjoyed basic maths problems in school, as well as art and biology/general science. My dad is technically a structural engineer based on his experience, and my mum  works in a minimum wage warehousing role (she has always wanted to do aged care). I find that over the years growing up, I have really enjoyed making things with my own hands. I love crafty stuff, making DIY things and overall doing very practical stuff. I really enjoy learning about human anatomy and how things work (particularly the human body). I have been told by quite a few people that I seem smart; I sound knowledgable and I am a very caring person. I did quite well at maths and art/fashion design  in high school, however just passed biology due to my 'lack of explanations'. Now I have proposed a few options for the future. I am really lost because I don't have the experience to really know what I want (like many others), but I am not in it for the money. I genuinely want to do something I am passionate about, to help others, or at least benefit others in what I do. I have been told by a few to consider nursing, however I don't think I will suit it for a few reasons:1. Burnout. I am really not a people person and the thought of talking to people all day just kills me. I am also emotionally unstable,  which can result in me becoming destructive to myself when dealing with the rude patients. 2. I have heard that nursing is progressively becoming a bad career to choose; mainly from the way patients are with nurses and co-workers. Many people claim that it isn't what it used to be, and I am not the best at handling stress. 3. I have also heard the horror stories about competition between co-workers and rudeness. I am really not a competitive type and avoid competition at all costs, for my own sanity.I have had engineering as a suggestion, however my dad told me not to do it because I cannot handle stress. I remember doing a small engineering course but I left due to the hostile environment; really rude teacher and students which management did nothing about. I have been bullied most of my life and there's so much you can tolerate before you shut down. Some people suggest lab science or something like that, however I consider myself to really lack in sentence structure (my dad has dyslexia, so I am not sure if this has any association with my struggles). Despite science being something I really enjoy, I take on the feedback from high school and fill myself with doubts that my vocabulary isn't to standard. I tend to be very pessimistic due to my family telling me that my career choices are 'unrealistic', or I wouldn't suit it. I drop out of minimum wage jobs pretty fast due to the boredom I face; either the bad environment or the repetition becomes too much to bare. I worry that if I don't choose what to do soon, I will be working in a minimum wage job for the rest of my days. Any sort of suggestions would help me a lot! Just feel like I am stuck in a continuous maze right now. Apologies for such a long post. Cheers everyone!
g3v118	1587243841	857	Hi all,I graduated with a BA in Psychology a few years ago and have been working in a field I'm good at, but not at all passionate about, since then. I'm starting to get sick of working at a job that I don't enjoy or care about, and I would like to start considering pursuing a career that will be more satisfying. Subjects that I've studied and always been passionate about include psychology, Spanish (I'm fluent), and visual arts (drawing, painting, etc.).I recently took the Sokanu career assessment test, which has been recommended by a few people on this sub. The personality assessment it provided me was incredibly spot on, but I didn't feel super excited or confident about any of the job suggestions it gave me. I think they provided the job suggestions based on the few jon-related questions, and less on the personal-related questions, unfortunately.Anyway, I thought it might be interesting to paste the personality assessment the website provided me with here, and see if you all have any recommendations for jobs based on it. A few relevant thoughts: I think I'd find social work-type jobs extremely fulfilling theoretically, but I think the compassion fatigue and burnout would be strong. I think I'd be a great teacher, but only if I felt extremely confident in what I was teaching. I'd also have to overcome a fear of public speaking, and I'm not good at disciplining people/children (like, at all).Ok that's it! I'll paste the personality assessment below. Thank you in advance for your help!* You are a guardianUnderstanding, Responsible, RationalGuardians love helping people. They have a natural ability to work with others, but also find time to work in solitude where they are able to organize their thoughts with detail-oriented tasks. Accuracy paired with helpful support makes the Guardian an excellent support system to turn to. A Social person is sensitive to the needs of others and does well in collaborative group settings where they have the opportunity to work with and help others. A Conventional person is detail oriented and methodical, feeling most at ease in structured environments where they feel in control.* You are warmWarm people are honest and put people at ease.People scoring high on warmth take pleasure in talking to and interacting with people, particularly in a one-on-one setting. Warm people put others at ease and are in some ways an open book, willing to be vulnerable and reveal things about themselves.* You are positive emotionedPositive Emotioned people are charismatic and approachable.Positive emotionality is a sub-trait of extraversion. People high in this trait have an energy to them that draws people in. They give off an energy and have a social grace that makes others want to be around them. Leaders with high positive emotionality are approachable and create work environments that incubate creative problem solving.* You are candidCandid people are genuine and sincere.You are one of those people where what you see is what you get. You tend not to adjust personalities or opinions based on your audience. However, this does not come out of a lack of concern for others, but a general straightforwardness in your style that occasionally catches people off guard.* You are altrusticAltruistic people are generous and empathetic.Altruistic people are good natured, and have a general concern for others and their feelings. They have a gift for making others around them feel at ease.* You are modestModest people are humble and unassuming.Modest people do not want to be the center of attention. Generally speaking, they see people as equals, neither thinking of themselves as better than others or others as better than themselves. While modesty is a well-respected quality in people, in the workplace it can be perceived as incompetence. It is important for modest people to work in environments that monitor and reward real output instead of self endorsement or politics.* You are competentCompetent people are organized and efficient.Competent people complete tasks successfully and on time. They can do this because they are methodical in their work and their planning. They take joy in organizing tasks and activities, which makes them ideal workers and managers in areas that require an exacting approach and tight deadlines.* You are dutifulDutiful people are loyal and responsible.Dutiful people believe that people should act in accordance with what is expected of them. Duty, living up to your obligations and responsibilities, is a virtue to these people. For this reason, dutiful people can make good middle management or officers, as they are able to accurately take guidance from their leaders and also instruct it to their subordinates.* You are deliberateDeliberate people are rational and methodical.Deliberate people are planners. They think their decisions through. They do not act on a whim - instead choosing to methodically think about what they say yes or no to. While deliberation is generally a healthy trait, it can be well balanced with a bit of impulsivity. Sometimes decisions cannot be fully thought through due to imperfect information, and instead of trusting their gut, a deliberate person might overly rely on rationalism or grasp at data points that are not truly there to help in their decision making.
g3ge52	1587179114	294	I'm heard people say find a job that matches your talents. Another will say the intersection between your interest and talents. I'm don't have any talents. I also have no goals or life plans. Really, I am just biding time until I die.The reason I am asking:I'm currently in Uni for CS, and I will be honest, I fucking suck at it. My coding is sadly terrible, and the best that I have ever written is nothing more than mediocre. Currently, I am currently failing all my classes (D+'s, need C's to actually pass). For the record sake, I want to say that this is in no way due to lack of effort. I love my classes, and I put my all . Sadly, hard work doesn't guarantee success as my grades indicate. I mean, since I don't know what else to do, I'm keeping with the program but bombing a semester sounds bleak. I tried Accounting my first semester in Uni and frankly I would fucking kill myself from boredom. Not to mention, I'm a fucking dumbass who now has a solid amount of debt.Being a paramedic is something I have considered, but the low pay and high burnout rate concerns me. I have a deep interest in true crime so I considered things like profiling or csi, but that feel unlikely amd stupid.I don't need to be rich, but I've grown up poor, and I'm fucking sick of living like that. I just want to live without having every paycheck going towards bills and groceries. Seeing everyone around me with the latest games, going on fun trips, not worrying about whether they can go hang out with some friends because you don't have the money to rent ice skates and get dinner after.
g1hls1	1586911183	530	I am looking for advice on my career. I am currently a 30 year old male in my first year of a 3 year speech-language pathology (SLP) program. I am already admitted into the graduate program and am just completing my prereqs before beginning the actual graduate classes in the fall. I did well in my first semester and am doing well up to this point in my current classes. My biggest concern is whether this is the right career for me. While I like hours of working in a school, I am not sure if I have the temperament to work with the populations serviced by a school-based SLP on a daily basis. I have also heard that the pay of school-based SLPs is not great, since they are usually on a teacher’s pay scale. Right now I can see myself being better suited at working with elderly populations. I worked at a nursing home part-time in high school and college and had a good rapport with the residents. However, I do worry about the hours of medical settings (weekends/holidays) as well as the dreaded productivity levels. I also do not have an interest in dysphagia (swallowing) which I know is probably more prominent when working with elderly people.I initially considered school counseling, as I thought it would be a better fit for my personality. I am a pretty outgoing person who enjoys working with people. The issue is that in my state (CT) there aren’t many jobs. I have two friends who got their master’s in school counseling and both struggled to find jobs. One left the field altogether and the other finally landed a full-time job and is already considering getting out of it. Some people have suggested school psychology due to the better jobs prospects and higher pay, but I have heard that they can deal with some pretty heavy subject matter including suicidal thoughts and/or childhood abuse, so I am not sure if I could handle the emotional toll of that day in and day out.I also considered nursing due to the numerous jobs available and the service aspect of it, but my mother who is a nurse talked me out of it due to high burnout rate and overall stress nurses face. She was actually the one who suggested SLP in the first place since she works for a visiting nurse agency and works with some SLPs who are in very high demand where she works.Ultimately I just want a career where I can help people, make decent money, and have hours that allow for a solid work-life balance. I worked in the corporate world for 6 years after finishing college and absolutely hated it, which is why I decided to make a career transition in the first place. I also need to factor in the practical aspect that I’m already 30 and would like begin working again as soon as possible. I am only interested in careers with a good outlook that will give me the ability to find a job soon after graduation, as I cannot invest time and money into a career where there are no jobs.Thanks in advance for your insights!
fynm2v	1586549233	54	I have been studying premedical sciences for around three years now. I really love it but sometimes I get a couple months of not even wanting to study or even try. I don't know if this is normal because of how stressful the schooling is or if I should just pick a different career path.
fybm4h	1586506503	452	I'm spending my pandemic free time planning for the future. I think I'd like to go to school for massage therapy but I'm reading a lot of awful things about it. The thing is, I read awful things about EVERYTHING I have ever wanted to do. Every. Single. Thing. So I'm at my wit's end here. All I want is to marry my bf and have a comfortable life together. The American dream if you will, which apparently is dead. I'm trying to figure out how to fund a comfortable lifestyle with a job I won't hate. I'm only good at liberal arts, so I'm effictively doomed. I'm just not cut out for anything well paying.I'm pretty good already at giving massages, so I figure with training I'd be really good at it. I'm okay with needing continuing education, and I would want to expand my knowledge even if it wasn't required.  I don't want kids, so I won't need the ~$233,000 to raise a kid to 18. My state doesn't have a personal income tax, so I only pay the federal income tax. To give you an idea, being comfortable to me means:-living in a 1 bed, 1 bath apartment in a safe area-being able to furnish that apartment with things that are more expensive upfront but are durable and last a long time -driving a safe, reliable, affordable car-annual vacation-date nights a few times a month (Olive Garden is my idea of "nice restaurant")-my husband being able to buy new video games when they come out-dropping $35 at half price books a few times a year-not being screwed if my car breaks down or if I need a new refrigerator-being able to save 20% of our monthly incomeNot paycheck to paycheck basically. I'm 24 and just want to get out of my parents' house and start my life already. Can I do that as a massage therapist? Will I really wreck my body in &lt;10 years and have to do something else? Apparently the burnout rate is high and the job satisfaction appears low, I'm just running out of ideas here. The nearest physical therapist's assistant program only takes 20 people a year. I have 2 years of college but my GPA is only 3.03. Should I do massage therapy and just keep applying to the PTA program until I get accepted? Could I even expect to get accepted with a gpa that low?  My boyfriend wants to train up to become a chef and open his own restaurant. I'm wondering if we should just both throw ourselves into that as a duo when the time comes, but he loves his work in the food industry and I don't.
fw27ez	1586191811	351	I just need some unbiased feedback. This is the worst time to quit a job, but I came so close last week though we are all working from home. I have wanted to quit my Lead Creative position for over a year. The work I do is for someone 3-4 years out of school. It's primarily print production work that requires very little thought..basically you'd be great as an Adobe Creative Suite Operator with 10 fingers or so.I am 15+ yrs. into my career. Been CD at two major orgs., had my own business for a while. Took this position when it was offered because it was building a new department/leg of business and I have done this multiple times in my career and really enjoy doing so.Since establishing this new department (3 years ago now, building from a 3 to 8 person team), it has evolved into something it did not start as and I find myself consistently frustrated with my project managers (who seem to have forgotten the very basics of PM, how to ask the clients the right questions, etc), the company owners (who I have zero respect for and who do not value designers' skill sets and have the aesthetic of a toddler), the daily tasks (remove that comma, replace that copy, add a logo, etc.)...IT'S NOT THEM, IT'S ME. Like my level of frustration is completely irrational or it's just been building for way too long.I am regularly applying/looking at other job posts for designer/director/creative jobs...apply all the time..nothing 'lights me up'. I regularly think, 'I'm just gonna go walk dogs.' I feel part of it is the dissatisfaction of my current position. I feel like maybe I should just take a break. Or go into a completely different career for a while...like banking or something.I would love to hear someone other than my parents or friends thoughts on this..have you been there before? What helped? Should I just STFU and stop complaining? How can I resolve this? Any tests i need to take to figure this out?Thanks in advance for any insight. It is truly appreciated.
fuwy9w	1586019025	593	I’m sure I’m one of MANY people posting about this same problem, so I’ll first just apologize about this in advance. I’ll also preface this post by saying that I know I’m fortunate to not be out of work right now.I’ve been pretty unhappy with my job for some time now, and right around this time was when I was planning to look for another one (ironically, I had gone on a trip before COVID-19 broke out and my plan was to do this after I got back home). In summary, here are the reasons why:* Long hours, understaffing and me agreeing to way too much in the past year has led to me wearing far too many hats. I’m burnt out, never able to complete everything each week and management is aware, but doesn’t seem to do anything about it.* My role has changed from one where I was supposed to be a creative contributor to my company to one where I just manage and oversee logistics all day. It wasn’t what I signed up to do and I don’t even get to do any of the responsibilities I was originally given when I started (which was work I actually enjoyed, is in line with my skill set and that was valuable for both the company and my resume). Duties that were once mine are now just outsourced by third parties and managed by me. It's definitely not the same thing as what I joined to do, at all.* Management knows I want to go back to my original duties and have repeatedly told me they will do this for me and reevaluate processes, only to then keep roping me into the very duties (mentioned above) that keep me from doing just that and doing absolutely nothing they promise.* Management is young, inexperienced and not good at fixing problems when they’re brought to attention. This results in me and other colleagues getting the brunt of other people’s problems.* According to market trends (at least before COVID), I was being underpaid and overworked for this role. I’m not sure if this still stands now.Overall, I’ve been unhappy for quite some time now and I don’t feel like this job is at all aligned with my career goals at all. I’ve managed to keep my job and work from home during the pandemic, which makes me feel like an even bigger POS for complaining. But with that being said, I can tell that taking our company online is already starting to worsen the lack of organization and alignment. On top of stress over what’s happening in the world right now, I know my mental health is not in great shape dealing with this role. Even prior to this, I was dealing with working late hours, extreme burnout and lack of sleep. I still want to make the best of my life and my career during this time and I know I’m not doing it here.With all this being said, I am perfectly happy with working from home (I'm a bit of an introvert and actually fare really well with it) and the type of work I do is very easy to do remotely. Is it worth the risk to still look for something else right now or am I making a bad move? I’d love to know if anyone else has greater insight on the remote market right now or what that’s looking like. It's been over a year since I've looked for a job and I've never looked for a wholly remote opportunity before.
fsnvib	1585697114	134	Thinking about going back to school to get a Master's degree for a career change. I majored in music, but I know there are many fields where you can get a Master's degree as long as you have any Bachelor's (sometimes you have to complete a few prerequisites, but I'm fine with a semester or two of community college). The main factors that are important to me for a new career are:* Pays upwards of $100k mid-career* Something that contributes positively to society and the world* High rates of work satisfaction, something that isn't super high stress, won't cause burnout, and doesn't require 50 hour weeks every week.Any thoughts? Are any of you/do any of you know somebody who's got a career like this that they're happy with? Am I asking for too much here?
fr6jm9	1585491513	1093	After 4 years of living abroad, I am lost as to what to do for a career. I’m a 25 y/o geography graduate from a decent UK university. Whilst finishing final year, I had no idea what career to go into - and the idea of grad schemes was soulless and unappealing.Instead, I decided I would be better off heading overseas and learning a language, and getting some life experience.After almost 2 years In Colombia working as an English teacher, I returned to the UK. I had some amazing experiences, volunteered for a charity to help local people build houses, learned Spanish really well and, although it would’ve been easy to stay, I was intent on returning home to join the foreign office, or the UN or frankly, any worldly organisation. (I spent half my childhood abroad as my Dad was also in the foreign service, and I was inspired by his job and how interesting it seemed)However, I failed to get past the tests and went through this period of almost reverse culture shock, whereby I couldn’t understand why I was incapable of slotting into a job, despite having a degree and a language. However, with hindsight, the problem was I actually had no plan B, nor any real idea about the working world. I lived at my Dad’s place (in the sticks), isolated from friends and worked in a warehouse to try and make ends meet, whilst applying for jobs in London. I’ve always been quite idealistic and originally applied for the charity sector (competitive industry) to no avail, before ending up applying for anything - HR, sales etc. - despite having no interest and knowing those industries would completely drain me. I cut out my ideals and began to just see a job as a way to pay bills, first and foremost.However, after a few months of getting nowhere and having lost my warehouse job because of injury, I fell into deep depression. I despaired at my situation and how I had no sense of direction, despite the fact I’m fairly confident as a person. In the meantime, as a temporary solution, I pushed off and taught English in Vietnam and then China for almost a year apiece...Again, same story as above. Great experiences, learnt some Chinese, but still no career aims. As great as teaching English is, it’s more of a means to an end to learn languages and see the world. I can’t see myself doing it in 15 years time, nor do I have any aspirations of teaching as a profession in the UK. All I got from my time in China and Nam was just more affirmation that I want to work abroad or at least with people from different backgrounds. I came back to London after my time in China, but this time more mature and with more money. I was also lucky to be living in London with my brother and Mum. Plus I’d had time to think, and decided taking a masters in urban development planning (urban planning for Africa, Latin America, Asia) would be a good option as 1, I enjoy studying and, 2 urbanisation + development are areas of genuine interest and 3, I thought I could use it to hopefully launch a career from (perhaps it was just delaying the inevitable career choice again). Fast forward, it went pretty badly. I completed a term and was doing well/enjoying it, but was not granted a loan, so had to postpone the course. (In hindsight, this looks like a great stroke of luck with the Corona outbreak.) I was also struggling to balance working in a restaurant with a full time masters and a social life. I fell into deep depression again and had a breakdown/burnout after the first term - only this time I sought medical help and have been put on antidepressants and going to counseling sessions since thankfully. Since then, I also got a job in a small insurance company. Whilst this has been a good learning experience in terms of getting a job in London and also helping financially, the work is immensely dull and technical. I’ve been on a 2-month probationary period, which I actually view as a good thing for me as I was unsure about insurance originally but thought I’d just try it out. I also thought I could use that time to then apply for more jobs in the civil service, to enter the foreign office at a lower, less competitive level. I maintained my professionalism, but as the project I’ve been working on is finishing, and no doubt because of corona, I’ve been given a week’s notice. Whilst I am anxious about how I will survive the next few months financially, and whether I will qualify for the government’s corona assistance scheme, I still feel aimless in my wider career path. But I do feel even more motivation to find a career which I enjoy. I feel the elation of being being abroad in a stable job as an English teacher a stark contrast to the UK, where not having any career direction becomes a problem, not least financially and mentally. I feel like I’ve always had aims to achieve, but that gets harder in adult life. I worked hard in school and was a prefect, got a good degree, went away and would say I’m a fairly well-rounded person - but still am lost career-wise. But I’m trying to be kinder to myself by putting less pressure on my shoulders. This is especially needed given my history of depression. More generally, I have an interest in international politics/current affairs and history. I speak good Spanish and am keeping on with my Chinese. I’m computer literate but not particularly technical otherwise, nor am I financially motivated. I have a great interest in people, where they come from and their stories, and engaging with them. I seem to gravitate more towards people not from the UK. Whilst comparisons with friends and peers aren’t always helpful, they are somewhat natural. I don’t feel any less capable than them. In fact, I can’t help but think the only difference between me and friends who are working in a career is that they simply made a choice. I’m aware there’s no perfect career and all jobs have downsides, and nowadays you can chop and change quite easily, but the question is, what would be a fulfilling career for me?If you’ve got this far, I appreciate you and your time. Any advice or comments are much appreciated. Thank you.
fl3xb0	1584592181	194	I am less than 10 credits away from receiving my bachelor's degree and realized I cannot imagine myself working anywhere in the job field I was studying for and had to take a break. Huge bummer. I would love the chance to go back to school or continue growing in a learning environment, however I don't fully know what my options are. I don't want to completely abandon my chances of receiving the degree I'm currently in process in getting since it was from a well known and highly regarded with an extremely low acceptance rate. Plus I'm so damn close to finishing. I want to go back and finish it after I deal with the burnout.   What opportunities can I consider that have a strong(ish) guarantee in landing a decently paying career?  Is it possible to pursue a completely different college degree program (ie. an associate's degree or bachelor's) in a different field of study while I put my current bachelor's on hard pause? Am I limited to certification programs? Is there an organization where I can receive more information on what my options are? Are there opportunities I'm not considering?
fislfh	1584232039	1138	I need advice on what my next career move should be, but first I need to give a bit of backstory. It’s a real doozy, so TL;DR at the bottom in bold.I graduated University with a BS in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, and a BA in Film and Digital Media. The original goal was to go into medical school, but midway I realized that even though I loved the sciences, I absolutely could not stand a sterile, and strict professional environment. Without sunlight or physical movement or team communication, I quickly begin to get anxious and antsy. I decided to choose a subject to learn purely for enjoyment and not caring for career possibilities, this was film production. I thought that giving myself something fun to learn would balance out the stress that going into a medical career was causing; it did not. I overworked myself to complete both within four years, and thus burnt out. Massively.Secondly, I had a jaw issue my entire life. The goal was to start getting it fixed the second I came back from graduating college, and get the surgery at the end of the year. No biggie, because of the burnout I decided to take a year off to rethink my life. However, because of complications, the surgery got delayed month after month until two years passed. Surgery took 6 months to fully recover, and I spent the next 6 months in community college for communication studies as a sort of therapy to get over the depression caused by halting my entire life for two years. It worked wonders, my head was back in the game. I began applying for laboratory and biology jobs like mad. I got a few interviews, but absolutely no one would hire me because of lack of experience, and because I didn’t transition directly out of college into a higher education program or biology career. In came film production, again. I tried to network through friends and family into the entertainment industry. I got in doing video editing jobs for basically dirt cheap. Think less than $1 per hour worked. The general consensus everyone told me was that this is how you enter the entertainment industry, by basically working for free for experience and connections. I did this for two years of extremely sparse work, shuffling from being on set as a PA and editing. The entire time, I still applied for biology jobs, but no luck. Two years in, biology interviews got worse and worse. Now I was being heavily questioned on my lack of biology experience, and my abnormal work history in the entertainment industry. If the interview made it clear that I was not getting the position, I asked what I could do to improve my chances of getting a position in this field. Their answer was basically: get an entry level position like this one that I applied for, and get experience. I was pissed because my interpretation of it was basically “in order to get an entry level job in this field, you need to get experience from getting an entry level job in this field”. I finally snapped after having one interview treat me like absolute shit, followed by another interview that treated me extremely kindly but told me the same “in order to get an entry level job in this field, you need to get experience from getting an entry level job in this field”. I said no more, I’m not applying for any more biology positions. Over the next year, I finally started getting headway in film production. I was finally being paid properly for being a PA (I decided video editing was not for me for the same lack of sunlight, movement, and socializing causing me anxiety), but the unpredictability of getting a position left me still financially crippled. I have been graciously supported by my family to pursue my dreams through financial and housing support, but absolutely no emotional support. They told me directly that they’ll gladly help expenses, but do not support moving away from a medical career. My extended family consists almost entirely of nurses who married nurses. So suffice it to say, they remind me often that they believe I’m wasting my talent and gifts. I don’t know what my next step is. My goal throughout all of of this was basically to enter through either biology or film, and transition to science video entertainment. Biology careers didn’t hire me, and entertainment careers barely hire me. I have kept my schedule very open to accommodate the odd entertainment career hiring style of jobs popping out randomly with “we need you to work tomorrow. Yes or no?”. But the lack of concrete steps to bettering myself is absolutely contrary to how I function. I work best when the goal posts are extremely solid and direct. Give me a project with high intensity work load and a deadline, no problem. But telling me “just do your own projects, learn anything you can, and eventually you’ll find an opening” is way too vague for me to flourish. I am collapsing under the lack of concrete steps. I’m glad that my efforts into film are gradually getting more consistent, but I need to find a way to support myself that is still compatible with the whole “we need you to work tomorrow. Yes or no?” of film careers. My brain is stagnating under the lack of constant goals and improvement. Would the proper route be to drop film for a while to get a 9-5 career until I have my feet on the ground? But then it feels like those years of just massive amount of focus on applying and networking just for this sliver of a chance would be thrown away. FOMO to the extreme. And if that is the proper answer. What 9-5 career could I do that would help me work towards my goal of getting into science entertainment? I just don’t want to put my goals on hold again, I feel like I’ve already lost too much time. And if you think I should be directly contacting science entertainment companies, I tried. I got ignored. If it helps to understand, I am an INFJ on the MBTI. The duality of freedom and social collaboration is what I’m looking for. \*\*TL;DR: I doubled with a BS Molecular/Cellular/Developmental Biology, and BA Film and Video Production. I took two years off after graduating due to medical issues. Biology careers won’t hire me due to amount of time away from biology, and lack of experience. Film careers won’t hire me due to lack of experience and network. The goal is science entertainment video production. I am too poor. And a 9-5 position is incompatible with unpredictable film gig positions that start and end randomly. What do I do?\*\*
fgxvx7	1583936449	657	36 year old located in Austin, TX, USA.I’ve been on sabbatical for the last four months. I decided to leave a professional job as a project manager due to a combination of burnout, depression, poor personal health practices, and mourning over the loss of an immediate family member. I do not have the job to return to. Ties were severed with my last company and I tendered a letter of resignation. Planned for the sabbatical to last six to eight months, but I have a financial buffer to last me up to 11 months from now. I’m currently working a gig job ~6-7 hours per week that brings in about $700 a month that has helped offset expenses. I will say that the break has done absolutely wonders for my mental and physical health and I am not at all regretting choosing to embark on it. Of note, before the project management job that I had for about eight months I was a customer success manager for nearly four years. Also, I have a BBA in management.After serious reflection, I decided during this time off I would use my free time to develop skills to make a career switch to front-end web engineering. I’m not chasing it for the money (it seems like a lot of people are). It’s something I am truly passionate about. But I do want to be able to pay the bills and be able to save. I’d be perfectly happy with an entry-level income of $55-60k. Sure, I’d like more but I’m under no false ideas that I’d be earning $100k out the gate like so many people seem to think. Of course, web-dev is just a branch of it, but I’ve always regretted not pursuing a Comp Sci degree as opposed to a business degree. I’ve been into tech from the time I was a toddler and wanted to pursue a job in it, but was pushed by my parents to go into business.Regretfully, I am nowhere near developer job-ready as I’ve been taking a leisurely pace since I felt I had a fair amount of time. My portfolio items are well done, but I only have a couple of projects that are mainly HTML and CSS based. Of course, I need some JavaScript-based projects and I’m not there yet. Also, I couldn’t pass a coding test or be able to do on the spot white-boarding to save my life right now. Soon, but not yet.Now though, I’m kinda freaking out. It’s pretty much a given that we’re spiraling into what will nearly certainly be a worldwide deep recession. Curious what best advice is on how I should tackle this. Yes, I know this is an issue changing daily and no one has all the answers.I’m seriously thinking it’s time to get my ass in a job ASAP because who knows what the job market will be like over the next 6-12 months, though I imagine it will not be good. I’m certain many companies have initiated freezes last week or this week, but there are still hundreds of project management and customer success management jobs in my city. I figure I could get something in the next four weeks. Even if the pay is below what it should be I’d probably take it.So just curious on how you guys think I should address this. The current plan is aggressively job search for a professional job over the next four weeks. If nothing comes out of that downgrade search to something like retail, data entry, call center, etc. Luckily my monthly budget (mortgage, food, gas, car, student loan, etc) comes in under $2000 a month so I can squeak by with a low paying job if I need to. I’d continue to hone my development skills ~15 hours a week by shifting to focusing on it during nights and weekends.Thanks to anyone for reading this and being able to lend some advice!
ffzrsp	1583780460	102	So I’m a college student and currently a nanny. Nannying part time hardly pays the bills and the caregiver burnout may just be the death of me. Recently my close friend asked me if I’d be interested in going through the real estate licensure with her. She also has family who is big into real estate and said we could basically be garunteed jobs at the brokerage they work for. I was super interested and am planning on signing up for the class. So I am here hoping for some helpful pointers, advice or just stories of experience in the real estate game!
fdszxh	1583401734	622	Hi friends,I work as a longshoreman - for those that don't know, we load and unload commercial vessels like cargo ships, and here in the USA we are protected by among the best unions in the country. Good wages, great benefits, awesome flexibility. I started three years ago, and I love the job and plan to do it for the next 30 years until I hit full retirement age. My father was also a longshoreman, and he got my foot in the door before he retired - thanks dad!OK so here's the weird part. Previous to this, I graduated with honors from a great university, interned on Wall Street, and pursued a career in finance that lasted just under a decade. I was a derivatives trader, earned my CFA, hopped jobs a couple times, and then started an investment company with some coworkers that failed in a hilarious and just barely profitable manner. The end result of it all for me was complete and total burnout, and lingering guilt for having participated so eagerly in a system that I have always had real misgivings about. Now my only involvement in anything financial is volunteering at my credit union, which takes like 3 hours a month.Anyway, long story short, operating machinery is great and I love it, but I need some more mental stimulation. Also, I would like to maintain a few marketable skills, because if my union gets busted some time in the next three decades, I will need to make a living somehow. Finally, I want to make the world better - how could I make the biggest impact while maintaining a primary job? I care about the environment, unions, and other lefty stuff. I have a fair amount of resources to dedicate to this side hustle. Lots of time - let's say I can consistently put 20-30 hours a week into this project, but with a flexible schedule. My work depends on cargo traffic, so it comes and goes, often on weekends, sometimes at night. Let's say I could spend $100k on this before going into debt or touching retirement investments, which I'd rather not. Preliminary ideas:* Law school? I think I'd love the brain workout. But it's probably not realistic to be a part-time attorney, could one ever make back the &gt;$100k price tag? It would be real tough to swing an internship or clerkship + my day job. But perhaps ultimately it could be a tool to be a more effective advocate for stuff I believe in? * Because I know Reddit will say it - learn to code? This could maybe be fun and definitely be something I could learn for free on my own schedule - but what's the end goal? I have done a bunch of vba and a little python over the years, but never created anything I am really proud of let alone something that I could sell...* My wife and I are building a house next year. I am very lightly considering acting as the GC for the project. I think it could be a fun challenge but also an enormous risk as my wife points out, lol. Best case scenario it would save us $50k, which would make this option the most immediately profitable use of my time. * Local politics/organizing? I have volunteered for campaigns over the years, and enjoyed it. But I don't know how to make an income in this arena, at all.* I could always just work as much as possible, stack some more cash, and wait for an opportunity or inspiration to strike. However, my heart wants to do something more immediately.Anyway, I would love to hear your good ideas or any feedback at all. Much appreciated.
fcuzj6	1583244148	568	 TL;DR at bottom. Hi reddit! I'm a 29-year-old female from Scandinavia. I knew I wanted to become a nurse when I was 13 years old, and in general I am pretty determined and ambitious when it comes to setting goals on different tasks. I've been working as a registered nurse at an ICU/Burn ICU for 8 years. I still love nursing with all its possibilities, but I know that nursing is not going to give me fulfillment after a few years. I never got into the industry for money but now after realizing how low the pay is compared to the responsibilities and the amount of work, it has started to bother me too. I've studied strenuously and without giving up to this point to get into med school, but failed 5 times in 5 years. Studying in Med Uni where I live doesn't cost money but the obligatory tests to get into the study program are extremely hard to pass because of the competition and requirements. Now I'm at crossroads on life situation / career path choice-crisis where I don't know what to do since I don't want to go through another 6-month study period for nothing (for the 5th time), it just feels too much. I think I'm going through some kind of postponed burnout, since the test requires mastery of bio/chem/phys sciences and I've gone through the grind so many times. It's been a long and stressful life situation that has been constantly gnawing my mind. The test can only be taken once a year and not succeeding means another year of stress and hard work. I really wanted to achieve this and it was something I really wanted... But now I'm trying to figure out other options and get over the disappointment.  In different kind of self-evaluation tests I'm often suggested careers with the personality traits of investigative, social and conventional, which I agree with. I've always thought (and maybe taught myself?) that I'm more of a conventional thinker than a creative mind.   I love to study, especially natural sciences, so I've thought that the "next closest thing" to a medical doctor, would be to study for example biomedicine/biochemistry/pharmacology. I fear that this is only a band-aid for my previous goal of studying medicine.   I feel like I've put myself into this locked box of healthcare/helping others and cannot seem to think outside of the box. Now I'm trying to take into account all the different kinds of career paths, also the creative ones, since I now have the possibility to actually think and dream about other things to do. With med-school here, one cannot have any doubts or plan-b's since the preparation for the tests occupy everything in life when it's on.  Based on this information, would you mind sharing ideas/insights/suggestions/experiences about this kind of life situation or what helped you to find your career in the end?TL;DRI'm a 29-year-old Scandinavian registered nurse, been working in the ICU for 8 years. Also been studying to get into Med Uni for 5 years, failing the entrance exam each time. Now burning out and thinking of different kind of career options, also outside health care, but my view on possibilities seems limited to health care industry/field only. Do you have any suggestions for me/can you share your story that have led you to a fulfilling career? Thank you! (\^\^)/
fcc0qu	1583155484	384	Am about to relaunch a job search after being unemployed for a year for health reasons. The kicker is that this was the second year I took off in my recent past, both were due to the same bout of burnout. I am a recovering perfectionist who in the past handled very challenging workloads as an executive assistant. I was the last woman standing in my last two jobs after the rest of the EA team fell ill or left for another workplace. I have felt great (undue) responsibility to keep processes afloat, while my health took a backseat until my mind and body finally collapsed. I was given a severance package three and a half years ago and spent the first year recovering and studying subjects at night college. After a year i took a couple of temp assignments and then a longer thirteen month contract. Unfortunately the latter turned out to be a very toxic workplace and due to financial reasons i wasn’t able to leave until the contract was up. After that it has taken me twelve months to feel able to handle a job after feeling severely exhausted and demoralized. I have done my fair share of self reflection and sharpened my pm and computer skills in my time off, so the time was definitely not wasted. I am going to look for part time work to ease myself back in and i’m confident that with proper screening and self care i will find the right workplace for me. The job market here is very healthy, my CV apart from the recent gaps is good and i will have no problem looking for places to apply. The kicker is how do i explain these employment gaps on my c.v? I am reluctant to mention the burnout as i feel that would make me unemployable, yet have no idea how to address the gaps without lying. I would hate to lie as i feel i learnt so much in my time off and have developed myself and given priority to my mental and physical health. Have you had experience having to explain gaps in your resume? How were you able to put a positive spin on it? Any constructive advice is welcome as i am drawing a blank here at the moment.
faqoxs	1582872554	234	I've been to my job at a digital agency for 6 months. Previously in house for the past 3 years. In the first few months, I've been killing it, producing good work for manager. Sure, there were the occasional mistakes, but those were easily fixable. But recently, something seems wrong with me. Deadlines after deadlines, and being chased constantly by the project manager. Working late nights just to finish work. Producing good work for one deliverable at the expense of another (which was filled with typos and the client screamed at us). Lack of confidence to do my tasks due to this mistakes, and obsessing over the (wrong) small details in order to get a perfect deliverable out, as well as getting more disorganized. My manager wants to have a talk with me about my recent poor performance at work, which gave me additional stress for fear that it would lead to a PIP.  I also face constant fatigue, and lack of sleep. There were a couple of occasions where I was struck with gastritis as well. Like i'm wishing for a day where I could truly disengage from work and not have it at the back of my mind, or just think about the next day at work and hoping that nothing will happen. I don't know if it's due to burnout, just a poor fit for the job, or just poor performance.
f5whw0	1582051392	43	I’m currently work in accounting and it’s quickly turning into burnout caused by boredom. I don’t have any experience in illustration but I’m trying to find a way in. What kind of jobs would be the best stepping stones for getting into the industry?
f3vne6	1581701942	105	My last day of work is tomorrow. I will continue school as I still enjoy it and only have a couple of semesters left. My biggest concern is that I am so deep in a state of burnout I'm finding it hard to do anything at all when I'm not at work. I have a hard time hanging out with the kids because I'm beyond irritable. I feel extremely fatigued and I'm having trouble keeping the house up. I went from loving my career to despising it, and feeling anxious and sick before work.How long will it take to feel better after some time off work?
f3bkzs	1581607654	254	Last night I had something of an epiphany. After coming home from yet another awful doctor's appointment, knowing I was going to have to find a new provider (again), I realized I didn't want anyone to have to struggle as much as I do to find the care I need. I currently work in a low-level healthcare job (no degree, just the relevant licensure), and I help patients do this to a limited extent. But I realize now that I want to be the person that helps people find actual quality care that is specific to what their needs are, outside the scope of just my facility. I know that the job title "patient advocate" exists, but I've never had any experience with them and don't know much about where they would work and what their job would really entail. I also know that being a case manager seems very similar to what I'm thinking of, but I've heard so many horror stories about social workers being overloaded with cases and just not being able to do their job as effectively due to being spread too thin and general burnout. I have about 6 years of healthcare background working for me, and I'm willing to go back to school while I work if that's what it takes, but I just want to know more about what this kind of job would look like and what I would need to do to get my foot in the door. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated!
f2iboz	1581468123	304	I’m 25F so one could argue I’m too young to be even saying this, but it’s true. I’m exhibiting all the symptoms, i.e. brain fog, lack of focus, lack of interest, exhaustion, anxiety, and irritability. I’ve shed tears every day for a week now because my workload is unmanageable and my boss is now telling me to work faster, produce more, even though I am getting results and making clients happy. I feel defeated. I accomplish things on my to-do list and I have proof I do, but it’s not enough for my boss. I’ve worked at 4 different companies in NYC in the last 3 years, so I have hopped around but I have my reasons which vary from shit pay (&gt;35K), toxic working environments, shady business practices, micro-managers, you name it, it’s why I left.  Of course, I can’t say any of this in job interviews. I’ve never worked for a large corporation, only smaller companies which I think may be part of the problem. I’ve always felt like I was doing 2 jobs.I’m frustrated  because I am truly a hard worker who has accomplished so much in a little time and I am proud of my work, but I’m beyond exhausted.  I am drained and have nothing left to give. I just edited my resume and am sending it out, but I don’t even know if I want to stay in my industry (PR/Communications). I have the opportunity to freelance in April but I’ll take a huge pay cut, but I am seriously considering it. I need a reset but don’t even know how I could do it. All of these experiences have made me question what I’m working towards as it doesn’t feel fulfilling. Please help. Any advice is greatly appreciated.TD;LR: 25F facing burnout. How to overcome it?
f2cdh3	1581445002	237	Hello,As the title states, I have been self-employed for the last 6 years. The last 4 years have been spent building an e-commerce company, and the last 2 I have been importing products from China and launching them under a brand name here in the US. I like what I do, but I am reaching a point of burnout always working by myself. I would like to explore similar opportunities with an established company. My ideal job title would be something like "Brand Manager" or "Product Line Manager" or Director of New Products. Those basically encapsulate my skill set and long term trajectory.My questions are:* How would a recruiter or hiring manger view my self-employment experience? Would it be discounted because I've been on my own, and may be seen as a flight risk? Or would it be a plus since it shows I am a self-starter?* How do I provide references since I haven't had a boss or supervisor (or even coworkers) for several years?* How do I convince a potential employer that I'm a long-term hire, and not just biding my time till my next startup?The deeper I get into self-employment, the more it feels like my only option moving forward. I would like to test the market and at least see what I could get paid for my skill set, since my current business is still in the growth stage and not earning very much.TIA
f1ep9k	1581280758	578	Hi all. I really need advice on how to best handle a sensitive conversation I have to have with my boss tomorrow about my "time management."Before I dive into the specifics, I will say I'm experiencing multiple symptoms of burnout. I work in communications from home, so you'd think there'd be flexibility. There's not. My boss is a textbook micro-manager. She wants to edit every single email I send. I'm looking for a new job now but I'm trying my best to stick this out for a year (it's been 6 months now). This job is ruining my confidence in my work and in myself and has affected all my personal relationships.Now why we're having the talk - My boss wanted a client report to go out this past Friday. I sent her the first draft Tuesday morning. She didn't give me feedback until Thursday at noon. This report is massive (usually a 50+ slide powerpoint) and takes at least 2 days to complete.  Anyway, I send the finished report back to her at 3:30pm on Friday. She doesn't give me edits until 5:51 pm on Friday. And the edits would have taken me over an hour to complete. I told her I'm logging off at 6:30pm on  Friday because I had plans. She said "Ok no problem" so I assumed I could just be done for the day since there was not enough time to edit the report.So yesterday, I get a text from her asking if I'm going to work on the report today. I said no. My boss then says "Let's talk Monday about time management. I'll do it today. I wanted it out Friday."This made my blood boil for 2 reasons. 1) I gave her ample time to give me feedback by sending the first draft on Tuesday. 2) She waited 2 hours to send me edits the report and expects me to work late on a Friday night to finish a report that could've been done Thursday if she had sent me her edits on Tuesday or Wednesday. Also, I want to note that I did complete other assignments this past week and had to attend to an "urgent" need for a client at 9pm on Wednesday. It could've waited till Thursday am because it was not that important, but my boss wanted me to fix it then so I did. This has happened a lot.So Reddit, please help. I know she's going to point fingers at me and say I didn't manage my time correctly, but I truly feel I did, and she didn't give me enough time to complete the report. I want to talk to her about 1) Average time it takes for me to complete a task because I don't think she realizes things take time especially if she wants them done well, 2) Establishing realistic deadlines and 3) Work-life balance. I can't be expected to work on a Saturday when I work 9am-6-6:30pm M-F. And if she does expect me to, I need overtime pay. Any insight is appreciated. I'm trying to be professional but honest in this conversation but it's truly giving me anxiety today just thinking about it.TL;DR: Boss is accusing me of not managing my time well. I disagree and think she doesn't give me realistic deadlines. I also need to bring up work-life balance and how I need more of it. How do bring this up in our conversation in a professional manner?
ezbbfk	1580917118	219	Hi, I am currently in the process of getting back into the work force after a 6 year gap and need help picking my direction. I worked in finance in 2014 and decided to leave for the family business. The business didn't work out too well for me (its still there but I'm not part of it). And now I'm trying to figure out if I should get my MBA or go and get a job? 30M btw.Theres a few options that I've thought about1) Study for the MBA for a few months and take the test once and then look for a job2) Get a job ASAP and study in my spare time3) Just get a job and forget about the MBAI did deal with burnout and stress from my previous employment and want to make sure I don't take on too much at the current moment. Part of me feels like if I don't study and apply this year for the MBA it'll start getting too late. Also I'm not even sure what job I would go back into as I have a degree in finance but my past 6 year experience has been in the family business (restaurants).Any advice would be helpful? Like where to start looking for jobs and what type of jobs to apply for.&amp;#x200B;Thanks
eyge80	1580773159	92	Basically my company got purchased and I got word in advance there will be a massive round of layoffs this week, including me as a manager, my superiors and my employees.  I have one offer lined up, but I feel exhausted, in the verge of burnout. Should I jump on the first thing I manage to find or take a couple of months off before accepting anything?  I work in business tech. Would love to learn new skills tho, including SQL. Got savings for a couple of months on my own.
ew3z21	1580383605	123	To cut a long story short, I am not sure whether I'm enjoying IT anymore, and would like to get the most out of my life. I want to do what makes me happy, and, as hypocritical as this is, I think programming is my passion, but I don't want to sit behind a desk from 9 - 5:30.I'm taking a cyber security course in September at University. I'm good at IT, but my fire for it has been dwindling recently. Do you think I'm suffering burnout from an IT job I do not enjoy (pre-sales), do you think I'm in a bad mindset (step mum has just died), or do you think I just need to find a new passion in life?Thank you

eu1yyy	1580012131	261	Hey all,I am currently in my 4th year of teaching in Ohio. To put it shortly and bluntly, I absolutely cannot do this for another 31 years. I love my job itself and the kids but there are so many added reaponsibilities and nonsensical flaming hoops to jump through that are being added every year. It is to the point, unfortunately, where the cons are outweighing the pros. Not to mention I work in a particularly low-paying district. I want out of the profession completely. I dont think a district switch will help.I have a bachelor's degree in Speech and Hearing Science, a 1-year "career enhancement certificate" in American Sign Language and a Master's in Special Education. I don't think I can muster up the motivation to do another full-fledged degree. Not to mention, I think college is extremely overrated, imo.Does anyone have any suggestions of other fields I could get into with my degree? I realize it is pretty limited. I'm open to a lot of ideas. I'm an incredibly hard-worker. (This is another reason I am done with teaching...there is no room for growth or promotions, and frankly, the union in our district pretty much just protects bad teachers.)Surely I am not the only one who has felt this way. What do teachers do once they have just had enough? I am saddened for anyone who is getting into teaching nowadays. It really is not what it is cracked up to be and each year I see more and more evidence of the decline of our society and culture.Please advise.
esfijb	1579715532	79	Im a nurse. I’ve only ever worked in clinics and the hospital. Nursing is a very hate/love relationship for me. I dont hate it overall, but its easy to burnout.Im about to finish a Masters in Public Health. Im thinking about applying for some regular, 9-5 type, office jobs in public health. I just dont know if i can picture myself sitting at a desk all day for the rest of my career.I am truly wondering what its like?Thank you!
erhsup	1579547000	277	Long story short, Job#1 barely supplements a livable wage. I also have about 10k worth of debt. I’m learning how to manage money better but I’m at the point where I want to get the hell out of my family home. I figured it would be way better to alleviate the debt first, while also learning to handle my money better, before setting off on the path of independence.I decided to pick up a second job, and it turns out it’s full time. I was unaware of the schedule because I was getting two different responses from the HR and the manager. So I’ve pretty much doubled my income which is just fine. I’ll be making about 3500 a month, and figured after the monthly bills, I can have the debt paid off in 3-4 months, and another 3-4 months worth of saving for a nest egg once the current lease is up. (I’m on the lease with a parent). My hours are pretty much sun up to sun down (17 hours), roughly 5 hours of sleep in between days. I have no days off, aside from 2 mornings and 2 evenings off (spread across 4 days). I’d like to keep both jobs for at least 6 months, losing the second job is not the end of the world, but it will delay my financial goals considerably. I’m afraid that this mindset will lead me to quit the second job once this motivation inevitably dissipates during times of weakness. So my questions are as follows:What are your tips to avoid burnout?Are there any tips to make standing on my feet for 15 hours at a time more bearable?
eqb0s3	1579317125	184	I’m currently a 1st year life sciences student in a relatively small Ontario university. In high school I was certain I wanted to be a doctor. My parents sent me to a medical school abroad. I enjoyed the area and met some nice people but I hated the school system, so I quit before finishing a year.I’m turning 20 soon, I live with my family and I enjoy it a lot more.However, I have no idea what I want to do with my life anymore. All the reports and stories I see about doctor burnout and long shifts are turning me off to the idea of being an MD in general. I don’t know what else I’d like to do.My goals for my ideal career (in order of personal importance) are:1. Low-stress (i.e. a good amount of free time + sleep) 2. Make a steady, decent income (ideally 80k CAD or higher)3. Make some meaningful positive impact on people4. Preferably work in an applied science (e.g. chem, bio, etc.)With my current location, program and priorities in mind, what would be the ideal career for me?
epnebl	1579199556	500	36/M/USThree months ago quit a project manager job due to pretty severe depression, burnout, alcohol abuse, and weight gain brought on by the workload, lack of work-life balance, poor management, and always urgent nature of the position. I know I should have left this bad company years earlier but I was too stressed to ever get serious about it. One day I just decided it was time to leave. My mental and physical health was the worst it had ever been in my life and I know it was directly linked to the job/company I worked for. I could write a book on it but will spare everyone further details.I was with the company for six years but in the PM role for only nine months. Before, I was a Jr and then Sr Client Success Manager over four years and then in Accounts Receivable the first year. Been floundering unemployed since then, but feel now I have gotten my head straight. Lost weight, stopped drinking, no longer depressed (I’d even call myself a “happy” person now), started exercising again. While I’ve exhausted most of my savings I feel it was money well spent.Originally planned to join a coding boot camp in December, but failed to even touch the pre-work before the due date. I convinced myself that I could self teach but still have done only limited exercises. I really enjoy the work, but have been focusing on getting my head straight for these past few months. In retrospect, if I put myself in a program as early as December I would have probably burnt out. I now finally feel ready and motivated to get my life back on track. I have been working on some Udemy FreeCodeCamp courses and find it enjoyable and love the aspect of “building” something as opposed to just putting out other people's fires.After some soul searching I’m thinking about making a pivot on my plan. Now looking at getting a part-time job to pay the bills as I’m running out of money. My approx monthly expenses are $1,600 (mortgage, food, gas, insurance, car loan, utilities, etc) not including any discretionary spending. Mother offered to lend $15,000 a month interest-free for (yes, this is crazy generous). I’m thinking that the best course of action would be to grab a 16-20 hour a week job at $16-20/h for cushion money and be able to pay back what I can as I go and then spend ~30-35 hours a week going the self-taught method for coding.I’ll aim to be ready to start applying for Jr Dev and/or QA jobs in late August as that will be starting hiring season.I'll be prepared to keep going into winter, and then if nothing comes about by that time I can return to my previous career as a project or client success manager while continuing to apply for dev positions.I’m just curious if anyone has some good insight/advice here or found themselves in a similar situation and what they did. Thanks!
eovm9r	1579053884	131	I currently work for a mental health agency doing case management, and I’m already feeling the burnout after just over 2 years.  This was a job I got pretty much right out of college, and was the only one I interviewed for at that time.  I love the coworkers and management at my agency, but I’m tired of talking on the emotional burden of 30+ adults who widely range in functioning/independence for minimal pay.  I’ve been trying to move into a position that’s more in line with my long-term goals (working in healthcare or sexual assault services), but haven’t had any success past a few interviews.  Since my previous job search was short-lived, what advice do you have for someone trying to move relatively early in their career?
emr5za	1578664238	654	 ***\*Throat clearing\*******\*knuckle crack\******SO.**I’m going to try and condense this down as much as I can, while also including relevant factors.*Background:**Graduated college - 1 Year outSoutheast → Northeast*  *Married &amp; Moved in 2 months, husband in medical school, together since 8th grade.*  *I do have generalized anxiety and recently diagnosed major depressive disorder. Have been talking to doctor about lack of motivation,  this is something I have been I've been extensively struggling with ever we moved. I'm thinking this is also 100% affecting me.*I think I’ve been experiencing extreme burnout at my job and I’m not sure what’s going on. I graduated top of my Interior Architecture program at school, won a few awards, blah blah blah. (Very proud of those awards, just dont think listing these things out is all that relevant.) I work a 9-5 at a international Arch &amp; design firm (300+ ppl in just this one office). Wanted to work there ever since I started my program, got the dream job, and now I feel lost. I *LOVED* my schools design program because I had the freedom to think &amp; design creatively. Now I’m actually in my field and it’s not anything like I thought it would be... I’ve realized that my career is a lot more technical and paperwork than creativity. Something I did not see coming. I’ve talked to my friends who work here and most of them have the same idea of just having to wait things out and *EVENTUALLY* you’ll get to do what you want after you get some years under your belt. Which I get. But I feel like I’d be wasting my time if I just waited around for something that will never come.I will say I had prior work experience working a 9-5 internship at a different firm (40-50 ppl), working on things that were far more in the realms of Indesign, Photoshop, Rendering Softwares, etc. Still had to do some dredge work but everyone has too at some point. But here I’m basically just doing corrections and reading through paperwork, there was a week where a coworker/friend and I were just reading through a manual and re-writing things into excel. There was one time where I got to design a space but it was small, and pretty much sink or swim.I’m not sure if some of you may know this, but in the design world it’s very common for people to work until they’re exhausted. A lot of people here come in at 7:30 AM, and don’t leave until 7:30 AM. Or some work on holidays. Or some work until 11pm. Some even have worked from 8AM, to 5AM, the next morning. I loved my career choice in college, but I don’t want that life for me. I get in at 8:30, I leave at 5:30. Every day, unless there’s a “fire” to put out.I’m just very confused and I don’t know what to do. I’ve talked to my husband about this a lot but there’s only so much he can advise since he’s in the medical world. I love graphic design, renderings, architectural collages, conceptual designs, making things like models, etc. I’ve told my studio directors but I’m not sure I’ll get out of this pigeonhole. I’m even contemplating making an etsy shop for more graphic design/art related work so I can at least see if maybe it's my career choice that's bringing me down. That being said, there is opportunity to switch roles in the office (graphics/renderings department) since they would rather keep you than lose you. But even then there is no guarantee, and it could take forever. And I love my work friends. I just don’t know if its the company, or the career.I used to have the drive to make it to the top. But then I got to the top, and now I’m just kind of complacent and don’t feeling like climbing anymore.
el0ncu	1578346118	193	I have been working as a QC chemist in a stone lab for the two years since I graduated, but I am starting to feel the burnout. I love the data crunching and overhauling procedures and making things more efficient and I feel like that is what I really excel at. However, because of the autism, I am really struggling with the interpersonal aspect of working in a lab with people who do not have a good reign on their emotions. I tend to be an easy target when things go wrong or someone is having a bad day and it's making me dread going to work. My boss has to get involved and make people back off quite regularly and this has happened most places I have worked.What are some possibilities for me besides working in a lab? I know there are some rare data crunching, work from home type jobs but I am not really sure where to look. I have also been throwing around the possibility of going back to school for business, more specifically logistics/supply chain, but I am not sure if that would be a better situation.Thanks in advance.
ekvtrw	1578325685	200	For as long as I can remember, my dad has been working as a handyman and doing the odd jobs for people around the area to pull in money. Although, he used to have entrepreneurial pursuits like a laundromat and starting his own contracting company, he just doesn't have the business mind needed to successfully launch ideas like these. So, for the past several years, he's gradually fallen into a real rut where he hasn't been contributing to the family financially, but more importantly, his pride has been completely shattered and I'm starting to really worry about his happiness. &amp;#x200B;Despite his bad track record with businesses, he was extremely intelligent in tech and engineering before he left the corporate world 20+ years ago because of hard burnout. The question I'm trying to veer back towards is whether there's some hope for him in a boot camp or any other retraining methods. My dad has always been the most compassionate man I know, but I know that he's been deeply unhappy for a long time and I believe that if I can get the ball rolling for him, then he might be able to start building something for himself again. Thank you.
eha25n	1577647030	626	To better answer this question I believe some detailing is necessary. I will try to keep it as short as possible.In high school I studied to enter Med School. After studying a lot of chemistry and biology I noticed that I might not actually want to become a doctor, but want to study something that is connected to the domain. So, about a month before my exam, I switched to biomedical engineering. There I studied a lot of things and truly love the domain. The first two years, I shadowed my physics teacher and did some small studies in physics and biophysics. In my third year I dabbled a lot in electronics, mainly because of the projects needed. Also, medical and pharmaceutical biotechnology became a large part of my interests, in my view it combined several field that I loved: physics, chemistry, biology etc. Fast forward bachelors degree time. Prior to this my physics teacher thought I would have my bachelors degree with him, it was a tough situation to refuse him. He was my mentor for almost two years, whilst the biotechnology teacher could not give a damn ( but I still chose this because of how much I liked it), therefore I did around 90% of the degree with the lab Assistant. Upon deciding on biotechnology it was a time of 6 months of going back and forth between medical devices (electronics), biophysics and biotechnology, I even considered bioinformatics once because of my skills in programming (python mostly but also Matlab from two years of signal processing courses).After finding out the teacher could not care too much, I kind of regretted choosing the field, but I kept reminding myself that I chose the field, not the teacher, and it was alright after all, I do not regret the decision now.While all this happened I decided to try for a masters degree in Austria, at IMC Krems (Medical and Pharmaceutical Biotechnology). The interview did not go great. i believe the reason why I was not admitted was because I only worked with yeast cells, not animal cells. Believe it or not, at the moment, I work in online marketing. Mainly because I was an avid volunteer in my student organisation and I have some team leading abilities, which the place I work at now needs. I absolutely like my job. I like data in general, I like running analysis, learning new things, dabbling in things outside my main profession. But well...it is not my profession. I could have gone and worked in a hospital, but the pay would actually be half of what I earn now, and I do not earn that much. I am in serious need of a career advice. I have done several career tests, personality etc. I know this sounds ridiculous, but I like everything. I see myself working in a lab, or a new electronic medical device, I practice programming daily for personal projects, I also see myself working in a research team. I have been in the dark for the last 2 years about my career. I am starting to have questions and regrets. Should I have waited another year and tried medicine? Should I start it now? Should I even go further in this field? I swear I seriously thought this through and I truly loved my medical device, biotechnology, biomaterials etc classes equally. I sincerely do not know what to do, and I feel that time passes so quickly and that I am going nowhere.I finally decided to write this because I need a fresh out of the box perspective. I am in a major burnout because I have been stressing about this for years. I know that I want to do something, I just do not know what.Thank you all for the help.

egeigg	1577470043	121	My boss is going to ask me if I’m still enjoying my job when I return in the new year. To be honest, I’m miserable and hoping to jump ship in 2020. However, I want to stick around long enough to get my well deserved bonus. My job did not start out this horrible. A counterpart was fired I was given all those responsibilities. I’m salaried and expected to continuously work 60+ hour weeks without overtime. I tried telling my boss I was going to burnout when this started but it was brushed off and never dealt with. I’m afraid if I tell him the truth he will find a way to get rid of me sooner than I’m ready to go.
efmc54	1577310573	458	Ok guys I need help... So I am the most indecisive person in the world and I've been stuck on this for a year now. I want to know what you guys think. So Im a 25 year old, 7 year community college drop out. I have ASD, ADHD, social anxiety, dissociation issues and Im a drug burnout, very high functioning with all of those however. I plan to go back to school next year but dont know what I want to do. Im stuck between two options.... Become an MRI tech or a rehab counselor. For rehab counselor specifically vocational, my route would be getting an associates of psychology for transfer                     \--&gt;bachelors degree --&gt;masters degree. I feel like I would love to help and guide disabled people as someone who struggled with disabilities my whole life, it would be very rewarding work for me BUT it would take me 7-8 years to get done as a part time student taking a max of 4 classes per semester (That seems conflicting for someone who wants to have 2 kids before 35 and have alot of things crossed off the bucket list such as partying and traveling while young). Alot of the time this career doesnt pay over 60k-65k, which is what I want for the lifestyle I want to live(60k+ working 40 hours a week in Wa state) Lastly, Im nervous my ASD  will get in the way and I wont have the strong communication skills counseling others.For MRI tech the route would be easier. Its short term, would prbly take me 4 years or less, is high paying(70k-80k) and has repetition/routine which I feel would be good for my ASD BUT I feel as though I wont be as passionate about the job, I would be settling so I can do other things. The career wouldnt be as rewarding to me and Ive been told the job market for techs has been declining drastically, Im not sure if thats true. I wish I can just launch a career with a bachelors degree guiding people with disabilities making 65k.  Ive thought about special ed teacher but they dont get paid during the summer, and Im not very smart in school to help others with their school stuff. I really like the idea of rehab and guiding others with life, Im not really big on helping with education so I dont know. I am just seeking advice/guidance. What would you do? What do you think I should do or think about? has anyone been through this?  Or maybe know more info then what Im putting on here?
e9hdpc	1576117591	599	I started working at my current company 7 years ago as a QA Software Tester. The first year was tough, but I stuck with it because it was my first office job (I worked with kids prior). Throughout the years, I slowly moved up to Software Support, and then eventually found my footing in Development.&amp;#x200B;About a year ago, we lost our development team due to conflicts with upper management. This was an offshore team, and I was the only one internally that knew anything about programming, so I was quickly named Lead Developer after. The first month after was very stressful, we had a large project that we were close to finishing, but needed to complete a couple reports for the client. I was able to finish what they needed, but I can honestly tell you it was one of the most stressful moments of my life, because there was no access to the old team. No one here knew how to address it, and I felt a certain level of responsibility to help everyone. We got through it and ended up finding another offshore team that we have been slowly building up since then.&amp;#x200B;Between a year ago and now, my life has been filled with stress and anxiety. I have had to stay up late to work with the team on a pretty much daily basis, and they have slowly started to show competence. The biggest issue with this entire situation is the fact that this system is the result of over 15 years of active development. Much of the development was done with one of the co founders staying up late to discuss with the old team, so there was very little documentation to be handed off with it. Even if there was documentation, the system is huge, and it would realistically take a developer roughly 6 months to be somewhat competent (and that was if they were in our main office where they could surround themselves with the historical knowledge that some people have). We have since hired a couple developers here to assist me, but it will take time to get them up to speed. Realistically, we should have double or triple the size of people working on this thing.&amp;#x200B;I was scared but optimistic at the start of this, but I am starting to see the writing on the wall. Everyday is a constant struggle, and honestly our best option is to rewrite the products and start from scratch. It is incredibly difficult to maintain the current software, because it is very tightly coupled and massive. I am really struggling with what to focus on at this given time. I know I need another job, but I am burned out everyday (literally suffering from burnout right now). My biggest issue however is that I'm not sure what I should be targeting as a job. To be honest, I have not done anything remotely close in terms of programming to what a Lead at another company would have under their belt. I can discuss concepts and ideas with other developers just fine, but when it comes to actually implementing, I just have not put in enough hours. I am definitely struggling to figure out what to target as a career moving forward (I'm 31). For what it's worth, there's been discussions to promote me to CTO here, but the whole thing is a complete disaster at this point, and I don't really see this company being around for more than 2 years after this. Any advice or words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading
e9fnjq	1576109180	100	I’ve been in my job for almost a year and I’m feeling incredibly burnt out. I have a career change planned, because I know I’m in the wrong one, but probably not for another 6 months or so. I don’t particularly care about doing well or not in my job, I just try to get through the day . The burnout is getting to the point where doing anything after work is exhausting and even things I like start to feel like a chore. What are some tips/tricks to make the burnout less damaging to every other aspect of my life?

e6udut	1575610705	576	I got a job as a Logistics Coordinator back in 2012 while going to school for Psychology. (I was undecided but hoped a Bachelors would open new doors, big mistake I know) Anyway, I kept being promoted in Logistics and ended up in a company where I was making pretty decent money (From 28k/ year to 45+k ) But about 3 months ago I just began to loose it. I guess the realization that all those years getting a bachelors opened no doors and finding myself stuck in a career I was never interested in just got the best of me. Currently I am driving for Uber to get by and trying to figure out my next move. My girlfriend has been very supportive and wants me to do something else even if it means less money because she knows how unhappy Logistics makes me.To make matters worse I can't really think of anything I'm interested in doing besides hobbies like film and fitness which I know can only be hobbies as I need a real stable job to get me by and Uber just isn't realistic long-term. Recruiters contact me almost daily impressed with my experience in Logistics and I'm constantly offered interviews but I just can't see myself doing more logistics. I understand the intelligent and financially responsible thing to do would be to get another logistics job and plan my exit better or at least that's what I'm told. However, I honestly feel like that's bullshit and is just another way for me to get stuck in this career even longer. I currently have no children or a mortgage or much debt so I think this is the time for me to get out and not later.Anyway, I know asking strangers on the internet what to do with ones life when one doesn't even know what they want is pretty much futile. But I guess I just want any advice I can get from anyone that has anything they would like to share. As I said, I am going to therapy and learning to cope with anxiety and stress. I am also getting by with Uber and taking classes for video editing and even made my first short-film and loved doing so very much. But I do want to get a steady job that allows me to save for a better future and have stability while I work on my dreams on the side. Unfortunately, Logistics was just supposed to be temporary and in a weird crazy way it's like no matter how much I tell my brain it's just a. job, my brain has reached a burnout point in which it simply does not want anything to do with it. I wish I would explain how it feels and I wish I did not feel this way, I really do as the money and stability were great.I even loved the people I worked with but for some reason it's like something just went off in my head and said; "I DO NOT WANT TO DO THIS ANYMORE AND YOU CANT MAKE ME" to the point it feels like torture just thinking of doing it any longer.   I know I know, that's just not how life works but I can't help but feel this way, I've tried. but just the thought of forcing myself to do a job I no longer have any interest on any longer makes me feel so miserable.
e5zcus	1575466811	1112	I am 21 year old student from Europe and everything is SO messed up. I don't know how everything came to this.Until finished high school: straight A-student. Then didn't know what to do, had some interest in psychology, thought I would combine it with a business degree and do something like marketing. Two degrees at the same time stressed me out, I wanted to get away from everything, I guess I wanted just to escape the pressure (atmosphere in business school was kind of it's own, VERY competitive).ÂI was so naive. I looked for orientation, my sister did medicine, she liked it, her first year was super smooth, she said if you get in you make it. So I idealized medicine, even went 4 days to see how work life is like in the hospital, had mixed feelings, scared of seeing and smelling disgusting things, but also fascination by medicine. I looked at the advantages of medicine: safe job, meaningful, plenty of fields to specialize in, mostly very nice, intelligent people in the field, no worry about income and one main aspect was: having skills that enable you to work from everywhere . So I spent the rest of the year studying for the entrance exam for medicine and I even got in (even top100). I was so happy about the result, but wasn't sure if medicine is for me. I started studying it, told myself I hated it sometimes, but I loved some aspects of it (endocrinological system, public health, brain, psychology-related content). A lot of negative self-talk --&gt; told myself I should have stuck to business or psychology.Depression hit me right from the start, went to a psychiatrist, started therapy, switched therapist as psychiatrist thought it was just a depression due to autumn/winter and he thought I would stick to medicine as he thought I was stable. The other therapist wasn't good in retroperspective. During this time I finished the first year of medicine and my depression decreased, had fun time with friends. During this I continued seeing the (2nd) therapist. The therapist thought I knew I wanted to do marketing, she never saw what the real problem was and until my depression hit again in the following year she didn't tell me that she was overwhelmed/that she can't "solve" the conflict in myself and that I should go to somebody else. At this point (2nd year of med) I was so lost I did 3 degrees at the same time:– medicine, because I got used to the system of the university, had friends, had already basic knowledge– psychology, because I thought it was the most interesting, maybe specialize in occupational/business psychology in my Master degree– communication, --&gt; because it was easy doable in 3 years and I thought I could get good grades and do a 1-year master program at an elite university in London (hate myself for this arrogant move)I knew it wasn't doable, everybody told me to stop/ to do just 1. I was just freaking dumb and continued until I had a burnout after 2 months + depression and stopped everything. My sister and my mother brought me to a "clinic"/programm --&gt; physicians, therapists (did therapy for 1 year now), therapist thought as well I am pushed by my parents to do medicine and actually want to do marketing, applied therefore for a marketing/PR degree at a smaller university for applied sciences. Still had the thought of doing the elite master in some kind of business psychology related field. Now I am two months in the program and everything starts again: Depression, negative self-talk, not sure i want to work in the media field, i mean i hate sitting in front of a computer all day, I think there a lot of downsides of social media, I don't really wanna spend all of my day with social media. I trusted the therapist, but all this time, this key topic was never raised in our conversation. Don't know if this therapy is working for me.I fucking hate myself. I know I should be way more mature, should take more responsibility for my actions, but every time I do, it ends in pure negative self talk.The truth is: all the time I searched the "Perfect solution". there is none. Instead of just enjoying life as a med student with a secure job perspective and interesting content in my studies, I chased the "dream" of working in marketing. I felt the pressure to exactly know what field I want to work in, but honestly I have no idea if marketing or psychology or medicine will be fulfilling or will fit. I just don't know at this point in my life.Right know psychology is most interesting to me, medicine, too, but I don't think I'll make it as it just SO MUCH to study. Every time I idealize something, then it gets difficult --&gt; I tell myself it is the wrong subject --&gt; I idealize something different --&gt; everything again,Also I focused to much on the study degree topic instead of forming friendships, having fun, enjoying my youth. My sister, her boyfriend and another friend (all med students) told me they couldn't picture themselves as doctors until the 3th or 4th year of med school. They just started it because the topic interested them and all of them were extremely insecure about the thought of being a physician in the first year. They just did one exam after another and now in the 5th year in the clinic they realize that they enjoy it. Why didn't I see it like that? I always thought everybody in my class KNEW exactly that they are in the right place. I always felt like an outsider, but there was no need to be.Now in my marketing degree I miss all the knowledge about science. Everything seems so freaking senseless. Right now I am again considering doing medicine or becoming a occupational therapist. My fear of psychology has always been: i think I wanna become business psychologist --&gt; notice I don't want to be in business world (no purpose/meaningful work) --&gt; regret not studying medicine. I feel like everything I do, there is just regret, regret, regret.Also I hate myself for complaining so much about my situation. I have NO reason to be depressed: I have so many options to choose I should be grateful to be able to study all this for very low costs. Don't know if the therapy I am currently in is working (has been a year now)ÂTLDR,: Started so many degrees: medicine, psychology, marketing/PR; huge depression, Don't know what to do anymore, too many options, just regret and self hatred.
e4mmu7	1575230047	411	 I am stuck between a rock and a hard place here. The thing is I love my job. I love what I do day to day. My co-workers are decent and I make decent money for my field. I have decent hours and I'm in graduate school and it's worked pretty good for me.My last boss quit a year ago and I got a new boss. I am a supervisor where I work so I have employees. We've had major change ups with upper and lower management over the past couple of years. We've had a ton of employee turnout due to high levels of burnout and low pay. I have at least 2 new employees each year for a small department. Whenever an employee quits, has jury duty, has a medical leave, or maternity leave I am responsible for temporarily covering their workload within reason. I am not sure why I am expected to cover the workload because it's not manageable. I have also experienced all 4 things above in the past 12 months. Previously the old supervisor covered for one month their entire time with the company and over the years I have covered 85% of the time. I have been covering for over a year for someone that was supposed to be temporarily away. I am expected to complete the work of myself and another person. I am expected to complete 80 hours of work within a 40 hour period. I have been managing to complete the work but not the greatest.Another employee quit last week and my boss made a comment that I will take their workload as well. I will be expected to cover 120 of work per week in 40 hours which isn't humanly possible. My boss is a lazy and doesn't work most days yet will not help me when needed despite being told so by HR. My boss is vindictive . My boss will watch me suffer and work like crazy and then ask for dumb things like I'm her personal assistant which I am not.I've been crying a few nights a week after work and usually have one panic attack on Sundays because I don't want to go back. My husband has a good income and he told me to quit but I feel guilty being unemployed. I am in graduate school right not so I cannot find another job due to the schedule of courses and internship I'm required to complete.
e407rm	1575135715	123	Title says it all. I know this job is having an effect on my health. I work 60+hrs per week, I’m anxious and depressed (depressed before the job, though. It’s just not making it any better). I’m not taking care of myself. But it pays ok and I don’t know what else I would do. I’d like to take the parts of this job that I enjoy-or used to enjoy-and combine them in one role but I don’t think that exists or haven’t been able to find anything close that pays what I need. It’s easy to say, “your health is important, just quit!” But that’s really not practical. So I’m wondering if anyone else has been in the same situation and actually succeeded...
e2eykv	1574855131	232	Hi guys, I started a relatively demanding job earlier this year. I haven't at all performed at the level I would have liked to and I feel as though my ability to do the job has decreased with each day. Over time, I feel as though my body, mind, and life in general have started to erode. About a month ago, I started flirting with the notion of leaving. The more I thought about it, the more I wanted it. Eventually, I unofficially and privately decided that I wanted to leave and have psychologically checked-out of work since. However, I have only just scrounged up the courage to approach management regarding the possibility of leaving. My employers have been great and have basically stated that they are happy to work with me to facilitate staying in the role, or leaving, if it is best for me. I do not have another job lined up and I do not necessarily want one right now. I feel as though there are things that I need to rectify in my own life prior to commencing another role, where the same thing will likely occur. I don't really know anyone who has been in this position, so I thought I would come to Reddit. Do you guys have any experience with regard to leaving your job due to burnout or any suggestions that may be of use?
e16sxr	1574637883	516	Education/Experience AS-PsychologyBS-Criminology Approximately ten years experience in law enforcement as an emergency dispatcher, then crime scene tech, and back to dispatching.Background/Situation: Now that I’m about ten years in, I’m burnt out beyond measure (I legit heard someone get murdered over a phone line today and could do nothing but sit and listen while others tried to find them...that kind of burnout). I’ve been looking for new career avenues. I think that I would like to teach at a community college part time and make have another role in education, somehow. But I  absolutely loving two wildly different ideas.Scenario One:I got back to the college I got my BS from and take four remaining courses to get another BS in Psychology. I then attend the local college’s MS in Criminal Justice with and emphasis in psychology. This degree is a fusion of public policy, criminology, and psychology. I would then teach part time, but try to become involved in creating agency policies / best practices and training regarding special populations (ie, Autism, bipolar, suicidal, etc). I would try to transition into role at a law enforcement training company and work part time as an adjunct professor in criminal justice and/or paycheck departments. I really love this aspect of my job...helping progress the profession to have better response scenarios, etc. I think focusing on what I love about the job would unburnt me out. 😆 I also have an autistic daughter and over the years, and it has become important to me to ensure responders have the tools to response and interact in the best way(s) possible.Scenario 2:I shift gears entirely. I’ve taken a few library science courses to test the waters and love that as well. I’d finish a new BS in library science, which is only 9 courses for me (because my previous degrees transferred so well). I’d then get a graduate certificate in school librarianship and follow it with the state required MLIS. I’d work in a school library and teach library courses as an adjunct professor at the local community college. I love the idea of teach kids about computers, books, reset h, etc. This would also allow me to get away from criminal justice all together—which may be better for my mental health and burnout. Concerns:I feel that I would be better able to get an adjunct professor gig if I have professional experience. With Scenario 1, I have ten years of experience and education. In Scenario 2, I have no experience but I do have the education. Scenario 1’s credentials makes me more of a competitive candidate. I’m also afraid that if I am not able to get a school librarian job or an equally appropriate level of job, that this would further delay by adjunct professor goals. Mainly, I want to “influence” the “next generation” as my coworker put it, but I’m interests lay in wildly different avenues. Scenario 1BS Criminology BS PsychologyMS Criminology / Psychology emphasis Ten Years ExperienceScenario 2BS in Information and Library ScienceCertificate in School Librarianship MS in Library and Information Science No Experience, Enthusiasm OnlyOpinions? Advice? Thanks!
e0289i	1574435371	137	Hello, this is my first time here. I work at a call center. I love my job of being able to help others. I try and help my callers to the best of my ability. I’ve been wanting to go back to college for awhile know. I dropped out of my old college in 2017, and I think I’m ready to try again. However, I have an associates degree in Psychology. I was working on my Bachelors degree in counseling before I dropped out due to severe burnout. Ideally I’d like to finish my bachelors, but should I get it in something else? I was thinking something like business. I think I want to make a living helping businesses grow and attract customers. My main goal career-wise is to be able to help others. Thanks so much 🥰
dxnzf6	1574005212	401	Sorry for the long wall of text. TL;DR - feeling burnt out, don’t care about my job/current career path, should I find something else?I’m 33, 10 year career, no family, college degree, and no debt. I’ve been working in the government world either as a civilian or contractor pretty much my whole career. I’ve never been in the military. I’ve had interesting work, gotten to travel to some cool places, and seen some cool stuff. However, I’m really struggling to keep this up. I don’t care about the work, I’m frustrated by the broken processes/red tape, lack of training, and abysmal lack of good leadership. I’m fine with the pay ($86k) but I can’t shake this feeling that I’m not supposed to be doing this. I find zero satisfaction from my job and it’s been that way for years. Whenever I talk to others about their jobs it most often sounds better than what I do. That may be a product of grass is always greener but it does make me wonder if it’s time to pursue something else.My background is logistics and supply chain but I pride myself on being able to learn pretty much anything (not trying to sound narcissistic). I’m getting the feeling I’m not cut out for the corporate world but I’m unsure I want to go into debt going back to school for something else. To add some details I’ve been with my current company 3 years and have taken a new job each year that is a step up from the previous one. I’ve been in my current position for nearly 6 months. Unfortunately after the excitement and wide eye newness wore off I’m seeing this job for what it really is and it’s more of the same disappointment.Am I reaching burnout? Is this a phase? Or is it time for me to truly consider getting out? I’m worried my potential burnout/lack of care is affecting my work. I haven’t been told this by management, in fact I’m told the opposite. Even though I’m told I’m doing well I feel like I’m not and that I can be doing better. Don’t know if that’s just imposter syndrome coming through or my personal expectations exceed that of management. Either way it’s hard to motivate myself because I just don’t care.My interests are music, physical activities, helping others, science (at least the application), and health (physical and mental).
duq8fo	1573465691	467	Last week my GM passed away suddenly. This has left many things in disarray and my District Manager is finally coming to my location and possibly his immediate superior.  I am looking forward to this meeting as our location badly needs to get moving in a new direction.What I would like to see happen is an outside person appointed as our new GM.  There are even a few people I have met inside the company who I think would be a great example of what we need at my location.  It has come to my attention that that may not be the direction things are heading.There is one person we will call Jeff.  Jeff has been with the company for some time and is in a different, but lateral part of my locations. I have no doubt Jeff can handle the job. My fear is that Jeff is going to create a toxic work environment and drive a lot of needless attrition. He demonstrated burnout in the last few weeks before my GM passed away, the people that work underneath him do not enjoy working for him, and he seeks to shift blame for things needlessly.  My gut tells me that if this person is appointed to the GM position the consequences are going to be dire.  He does make sense on paper for an "easy" answer to this vacancy if no one outside is brought in.I myself do not feel ready to take over this position with my current time with the company.  I have a good idea how things are supposed to run as I have had time in other locations while training to pick things up.  The trouble I have had is as much as I did like my GM, I would have described him as a caretaker and someone that likes to do everything.  He never did make time to keep up and make sure myself and another person with my position we will call Candice, were on track to eventually become a GM at another location. Candice has experience as a DM from another company, but we joined at about the same time and I would say our development is at about the same place right now.I know this DM that we now have is a "if you have a problem you better have an idea for a direction for a solution" kind of person. I need help on what to do about this in my meeting with him and possibly his superior tomorrow and how to approach it as I have a really strong feeling if this is the direction they are going to go. I have nothing against Jeff and get along with him fine but he is not the right fit.
dso0yt	1573080245	228	I am really torn here and I need some guidance. TLDR 24/m works full time job and goes to grad school. Would taking on a second job and working 7 days a week be worth it or mentally draining?I a graduated college about 18 months ago and am currently working 40 hours a week in a marketing role. Not super stressful, but it has bad days. I am also going to graduate school because my employer is paying for it. Graduate school is also not super stressful and I can manage it relatively easily. However, I have about $20,000 left in student debt that I want to get off my mind very badly. I would love to be debt free by the end of 2021. But I will still be about $7,000 short at the end of the year (assuming no promotions or raises). I recently was given the opportunity to work a supply chain job every Saturday and Sunday. The pay would be $17,000 a year and by my math I would certainly be debt free by the end of 2021. But will working 8 hours a a day, 7 days a week, on top of going to graduate school affect my mental health too much? On paper, it seems like the smart move, but I don’t want to burnout and hate myself in a few months.Any advice?
dowzjy	1572386179	327	Hey everyone.Long story short, I hit the burnout phase. I’m drowning in it. Everyday I wake up and go to work feeling demotivated. Been a year since I’ve been thinking of quitting. I applied to a lot of jobs but didn’t follow up on applications, lost motivation due to continuous rejections and poor/low offers. So here I am. Asking you about advices:* My current job: we suffer from financial crisis, the salaries are never given on time, always with +10 delays, it causes a lot of trouble for me. The job tasks are unclear and it’s been months that we don’t work on any project. So I go to work and basically, do nothing... except working on my résumé and browsing job portals. It’s literally killing me inside. The income is not steady at all. Whenever I ask my boss when are we getting paid he tell me « I don’t have any visibility »* I applied to a job in a call center, \~ I’m highly overqualified (master’s degree in Marketing, 3yo of experience...) but it’s a decent job that’ll at least give me the financial stability that I need.The problem is: the salary is lower than my current one (-300$ difference). But it’ll be at least given on time and continuously. Unlike my current job where I have to get loans so I can Survive the rest of the month.* I’ll be actually working on something. Having sales objectives and plans.The call center job offers fast career evolution and a lot of extra bonuses.So I have two options:1/ stick to my current job, feel unproductive, worthless, bored, and poor. My salary fades away even if it’s relatively high. Because it lats for +40days due to the company’s income delays. \~ keep applying for jobs that match my profile.2/ Quit and go for the Call Center job. Get a steady income. Do some work, even if it happens to be repetitive. \~ keep applying for jobs.Which option you’d pick?

dog0ze	1572299307	455	I am 25 and in need of a career change.  I stumbled into a very well-paying healthcare software/IT job right after college.  I am expected to work at least 45 hours a week (sometimes 50 or more), and almost all of my time is spent alone on a computer trying to prioritize my 100 daily emails and client meetings.  While I know I could probably change companies within a similar industry and take a pay cut in exchange for less stress, my gut tells me that this type of a job is just not for me. Prior to this job I had always thought about becoming a teacher - maybe even a special education teacher.  I was a philosophy major, but spent most of my intern/work experience with various nonprofits or working with kids and/or disabled populations.  I'm highly service-oriented and a bit of an idealist.  My brain is always trying to synthesize big ideas and communicate complex systems and ideas to others.  As long as my heart is in it, I'm not afraid of work that is physically, mentally, or emotionally difficult.  I used to see myself as a natural leader and a teacher - but I have lost some of that spark.  While my current job is mentally stimulating (most of the time), it is 0% emotionally engaging - which I feel is something I need in a career.  All of this, I hope, makes it obvious why I would be pulled toward these types of careers (see title).  But so many people have told me that these jobs are too stressful these days (underpaid, over-regulated, overworked, etc).  And while I haven't taken these vocations off the table, I have been extremely discouraged.  I know that there are valid reasons why I should be careful to assume "I can handle it," so I want to consider other options that could still be a good fit for me.  **So.  Wise Redditors: what else is out there?  Or should I just fight the odds and tell the naysayers to keep their opinions to themselves?**  Bonus context/info: I would like to stay the course at my current job through next summer, but would then be willing to attend graduate school full-time.  I have also been interested in the fields of journalism and environmental conservation, but I feel like the former probably requires too much self-promotion for my liking, and the latter doesn't seem to have many job opportunities (also I probably don't have enough science credits for a masters-level program).  I think I would probably be satisfied to keep my love of writing and nature as personal hobbies.

dma8lz	1571885332	201	Hi Reddit! I would love some insight on what career path I should explore next. I’ve worked in PR for the last 3 years and while I’ve been successful, I don’t think it’s the career for me, so I’m thinking about what to do next. Some more info below.Things I love:- Making collages and making moodboards- Creative writing- Helping people and making them feel good - Food and wine (not all that helpful but!)- Nature, being outside- WeddingsThings I dislike about PR:- Boring monotonous writing. Hardly anything I ever wrote was newsworthy. I love creative writing though.- Mostly felt like I was selling boring stuff.  Always sending emails to journalists with unnewsworthy pitches and press releases.- I think I’ve learned the fast pace environment comes across as unorganized to me, and most PR firms thrive off the whole “fast paced working environment” slogan. I dislike unorganized rush places. I’d rather move at a slower pace and produce a solid product then shell out a half-assed product. Things I liked about PR:- Pushed me to be social (though at times I felt burnout)Any thoughts of ideas would be helpful! I will say I’d love something a bit more creative. Thanks for reading!

dlcrcv	1571719140	396	I’ve been working in a nonprofit ministry for the last 5 years, and probably do the work of about 5 people - I fundraise/keep up with donors, plan events and retreats, give talks, develop training materials, mentor students, develop leaders, lead meetings, and a host of other random activities. I also started this particular offshoot of the overall nonprofit so I’ve mostly worked solo in my day to day, and began this chapter from the ground up, bringing it to where it is today. Because of the context I work in, I’ve been exposed to a high volume of traumatic stories and combined with the workload, my stress and anxiety is at an all time high. As I’m moving next summer, I’m planning to make a career change. The biggest source of stress for me is fundraising. I’m good at it but I find it extremely stressful, especially phone calls. The constant communication with either donors or students has been draining, especially as I’m increasingly becoming aware that I’m dealing with serious burnout. I’m seeing a counselor to deal with the stress/burnout but I know a career change is also needed. I’d like to be in a job with more stable hours (think roughly 9-5). Some of my favorite parts of my current job are the public speaking/teaching elements and event planning. I also really enjoy collaborating with teams - working solo has been one of the hardest parts of this job for me. I have a bachelor in interpersonal &amp; organizational communication but looking back, my degree feels vague and hard to translate into a specific job. I know I have a lot of marketable skills from my current job but I’ve never worked in a traditional office and don’t know where to even start. I’m looking into jobs such as public school admin, academic advisors, volunteer coordinator, or other more administrative roles, though I’m open to other options. My main goal is to be less stressed and have a life outside of work, instead of work taking over my life the way it has these past 5 years. It’d also be a huge bonus if I can find a career that pays more (I currently earn $39k which is not a lot in the area I live and I’m just barely getting by). What are some careers I should consider given my skills and experience?
divkdj	1571258997	526	I started out chasing my dreams to be an artist and professor. I did that, was making art full time and teaching as full time as I could get. I loved my students and my work, hated the institutions with a passion, had no healthcare or safety net, couldn't pay my bills. Coudn't afford a car, etc. Out of financial desperation and stress burnout, I turned to working in custom fabrication. Started as shop help, worked up to project manager. I'm currently a senior project manager for a trade show company. We build/rent booths for trade show conventions. The work is boring, the projects are boring, the pay is decent (upper 5 digits), the benefits are ok, the people are overall friendly, work culture is not toxic. I just don't care about the work or the projects or the types of clients we have. I do the job, I get stuff done, I do it right and take care of business. I go home, and that's that. i don't think about work until tomorrow morning when I walk into my office. I don't answer the phone or emails off hours, and no one gives me grief about it. I've had jobs in this field (fabrication, not trade shows) that I cared about, a lot, and worked 70-100 hours a week at. In ways this is worse (obviously would prefer to care or have investment in what I spend my life doing, also miss the international travel), in ways it's much better...not overworked. Don't take work home. Don't stress about work. I have tons of hobbies (too many probably), volunteer, and make art outside of work. It's nice. I go home and home is home and I get rest and do things I love in my freetime. I'd love to be back to freelancing where I could set my own schedule and didn't have to sit in the same office everyday, but it's not all bad. So at this point I'm thinking...the financial freedom is nice. I don't need my work to be my passion because I have enough of those and my previous attempts at making my passions my job have led to me hating my passions and hobbies. So...which way can I go to get more money and freedom, while doing work I'm more interested in? I'm talking around $125k, set my own schedule, and doing mentally very challenging work involving design problems. I'm very good with working in 3 dimensions, very good at woodworking but hate doing it as a full time job. I have taught myself some code and do well with it, I know various CAD softwares, I'm an excellent teacher. Good with mechanics (have rebuilt many cars and motorcycles). Pretty good at math and geometry but lack the education. Totally willing to go back to school if it gets me where I want to go. I'm thinking industrial design, engineering, architecture, start my own business building 4x4 vans, start my own business doing custom millwork or other aspects of interior architecture like retail fitout, etc. I am NOT good at sales or anything medical (I get queasy just talking about surgeries, etc).
dia9at	1571156579	317	Ive worked as a nurse for about 5 years. I thought my passion was helping people, but it turns out following my passion has lead to pretty bad burnout. I knew pretty soon on that nursing was not for me. I didnt want my nursing degree to go waste, so I enrolled in a masters in public health program. Now I am almost done with my MPH and dont even know if i really want to work in public health - I started the degree as a way to get out of nursing. I honestly dont even want to finish my degree, but i only have 4 classes left. I feel like it would be such a waste of time and money to quit the program now.Im pretty miserable at my current job. Its significantly affected my personal life outside of work. Ive been feeling extremely burned out. I go home every day and just feel drained and depressed. I feel so burned out that I cant clearly think about what I want to do. Ive seen a career counselor but didnt feel that it was very helpful - they tried to get me to consider alternative nursing jobs. I dont want to do nursing of any kind.I have debt that im working on paying off, so I dont have flexibility to just quit my job with no plan or job lined up.I just feel super lost and dont know what to do. I think im pretty burned out of healthcare, and dont want to do anything related. I just want a job that pays enough for me to live well and is mentally stimulating. I DONT have to be passionate about it. I feel pretty open to anything, but dont want to go back to school again and dont feel very qualified for a lot of jobs with just a nursing degree.I dont know what to do.
dhxcpt	1571088211	181	**Context**: 4 years at a large management consulting firm.**Situation**: feeling ridiculously burnt out these days due to quite a few wheels spinning, almost all of which are negative. Internal politics, client politics, unrealistic expectations, borderline toxic team environment, super long hours, coast to coast travel, high pressure from leadership leading to stress / anxiety.The resulting burnout has led to greatly decreased motivation and efficacy. I pretty much know for a fact that this isn't what I want to do for the rest of my life. I joined to build a good career foundation and get a sexy name on my resume, both of which I feel have been accomplished.**Question**: How do I leave this job in the most graceful way possible? I would like to maintain the good relationships I have worked hard to build but am not willing to sacrifice my physical, mental, and emotional health in order to do so. I have realized that at some point you need to put yourself and your interests first. I feel that time is quickly approaching for me.Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
deo89m	1570475930	268	I am miserable at my job. Ive been feeling burned out for the past year...and its only been getting worse. I feel like im at a point of really bad burnout. I’ve kind of given up. This burnout from my job is starting to affect my mental health and personal relationshipS pretty negatively.The job is not a great fit for me. Im already burned out of my profession in general. And I work in a tiny office where I work closely alongside a supervisor thats does a lot of stuff i am not comfortable with...but dont want to write online.Ive been working on a masters degree. I will finish the degree by the end of May. The main reason I keep sticking out my job is because I can use the office I work at as my site for my masters degree practicum.It seems easier to stick out the job in order to get a new career once I finish the degree...rather than to get a new job (only to plan to leave once finished with the degree) and also find a practicum site.The end of May is almost 8 months away. (that is when I would finish the practicum and degree). I dont know if it is worth the negative effects on my mental health to stick it out. Do I continue to suck it up and just try to fill up every hour outside of work with stuff to look forward to? Or do I just accept Ive been burning out for over a year and just need a new job?Would you stick it out or leave?
dcvx2q	1570131485	140	I'm going to school to be a teacher, yet now that I'm working at a daycare, I find it's not what I want to do. I've been toying with the idea of being a medical assistant and perhaps going further with that, but I only had 6 credits left in my AA to be a teacher. It's geared towards children with special needs. My son is three with autism and I've been helping the kids at the daycare with special needs are typically sent my way. I don't mind it, I enjoy it, but I find I may be burnout way sooner than I thought. Then there is the issue with teachers going around as is. If you do something a child interprets wrong, you can be fired in the blink of an eye and that thought is terrifying. Anyway, thoughts?
d9tq8u	1569549662	397	TLDR at bottomSo, I work at a small, very progressive nonprofit and I LOVE my job, but have some grievances, mostly about my work/pay ratio, but some other stuff related to me having to also do other people’s work to get my work accomplished. I’ve been totally honest about them and have been very clear that I am burnt out. My boss is one of my biggest advocates and is completely on my side. Like, I often have cried to her about these things and just how stressed I am and we’ve tried to find a solution to them, but there just straight up isn’t one currently. I’m told that these things are going to be addressed by the higher ups. But the light at the end of the tunnel keeps getting moved back just a few more months every time, for a little over a year now. Like, hiring another person, giving me a much bigger raise, having more clearly defined goals so I can cut the work that doesn’t need to be accomplished- that kind of thing. Here’s where I’m seeking advice- I’m just so exhausted after working 60 hour weeks for nearly two years and never having the ability to take a vacation that I just get so frustrated and cry, like every time I talk about these things on the real and not in like a kinda aggressive stand up for myself kinda way. I’m meeting with a hire up boss (also a woman) tomorrow at the advice of my boss. My boss says that I put on a tough exterior and talk about this kind of stuff very matter of fact and that it would be really motivating to these higher up bosses if I were vulnerable, because they know the issues but they don’t understand the impact. That scares me to death and also seems way unprofessional. Again, we’re a small organization so we all know each other and very progressive, so authenticity and self care are widely preached. I’ve got a fine relationship with this boss I’m meeting with tomorrow, but not like, super close. So, I don’t know, how would you all handle this situation? TLDR: I’m really burnt out at my job and am meeting with a kinda friendly higher up boss about it tomorrow and am pretty sure I’m going to cry. What should I do to prepare?
d8ymqa	1569387632	159	Hi all. I have been career coaching for several years, and am refining my latest program helping professionals recover from corporate burnout. I’m looking to interview 10 corporate professionals who believe they fit this description - when I say burnout, I mean it. I’m talking exhaustion, fatigue, inability to recharge, irritability, despite having tried other methods.  This would be a 15-30 minute phone conversation where I will ask you about 5-10 questions. In return for your time, I will offer a complimentary 50 minute coaching session, which I would typically charge $200 for. THIS IS NOT A SALES CALL. There isn’t even a program to sell. I’m just looking to do a bit of research and can offer something of value to this audience in return. Ideally you would have been in the workplace for at least 5 years and employed in a managerial capacity - ie:  not entry level work. Just let me know if you’re interested.

d62wub	1568835243	352	A bit of context:Started new job as executive committee member in private country club in the springWas hired for specific role and mandate within organization (take lead and improve quality of food, service and coat control for member service, groups are taken care by another manager who has been in place for over a decade)One month in, groups manager goes on burnout leave.In his absence, I took on both roles and restructured everything. Member satisfaction went through the roof, member spend is up by 20% +, overall revenue (including groups) is up 30%. I worked 74 days straight with an average of 84 hours a week without complaining or even mentioning it.For some additional context, there was a big shift this year and a lot of the management team retired (some forced to) after 25+ years of service due to terrible performance of the club and satisfaction. Myself and 2 others were brought onboard to fix the place up.This other manager who went on leave had a terribly negative attitude, refused to apply and implement new standards, policies and practices. Didn't share knowledge, didn't pitch in to help the team.We don't think this person is coming back and even if he is. The whole role and structure of the division will be changed.  My new role (which is essentially what I have been doing for the last 3 months) will remain the same and I will oversee the whole division, not just a part of it. While I welcome this change and the restructure was my idea, my new role all of a sudden has a lot more responsibility.I asked for a 20% raise along with a few benefits.What do you guys think, did I go into this négociation too hard and before it even was one? I wanted to be pro-active and have them know I am expecting more compensation for more responsibility.Since it falls on me to establish and budget the new structure I figured I could make it work with the same kind of budget that I had for this year (controls were very lax by the old administration).
d5ruq6	1568776622	75	I am a financial analyst and I have been for six years after leaving the sales field. I feel way too stressed and exhausted every day of work, and I know it isn’t supposed to be like this and it definitely wasn’t like this when I started. I have slipped up on my work already this week and it is Tuesday. I need suggestions for what the next step is. How do you cope with burnout?
d3dro5	1568319626	109	Sorry for the long title, but is it just me?? I'm considered a very caring person and so my friend and family are always saying how I should be a nurse or a counselor. And yes, those are great careers-- but, I know that I'd probably get burnout pretty fast, as I sometimes burden myself with the struggles of others. But knowing this (and myself), I still feel like I need to fulfill a role like that to meet my full potential and since I don't think I will, I feel like a failure. Does anyone else deal with this? Any tips on how to separate yourself from these expectations?
d11imo	1567889686	451	Hi, everyone. Basically my story is this: grew up hearing "be the person you needed when you were a kid." Well, the person I needed was someone who helped those who suffered immensely as a result of mistreatment by their faith communities heal, so that's what I did. Got an MFA in creative writing with a focus in spiritual memoirs and an MDiv with a focus on ethical leadership and pastoral theology.Now in my early 30s and two problems have arisen: (1) I've been researching trauma for so long that burnout and compassion fatigue are daily realities (2) the other thing is, even though I've had a positive reception everywhere I've attended and worked, there's virtually no room for upward mobility or security in academia (and a lot of exploitation), at least in my experience. Though I've contemplated a PhD, my friends who have them (even from highly-ranked institutions) have begged me to save myself/jump ship and I feel more and more inclined to take their advice.I'm also worrying more and more about money these days, especially with signals of another recession on the way. Higher ed doesn't seem stable, but I worry that the nature of my degrees and the skills I worked on while in them are too "soft" to give me upward mobility in other areas (corporate, nonprofit, gov't, etc). I'd be willing to get a license or certificate (maybe even another degree if I could work alongside it) if I could find decent funding and it would prove a useful, hard skills-oriented complement to what I've done thus far but I don't know where to begin. The only thing that seems safe these days is the sciences, and they've never been at the top of my passions *or* skills list (and I have a BA rather than a BS which is limiting). A friend suggested law since I love advocating for people but I'm not sure that's terribly stable these days either, considering the level of debt for, in many cases, an income that's lower than hoped for (I'd be open to learning more though).The passions are writing, religion, psychology and advocacy. It's been my dream to support myself writing but, if that ever happens, I don't plan on it happening soon and I would love to have a career alongside it where it isn't quite so isolated and I can have more tangible (and regular) goals.**TL;DR:** Academic with terminal graduate degrees in writing and leadership/ministry ready to bounce for opportunities with greater security and more upward mobility. Where might I look, or what licenses/certificates/degrees might I pursue that could complement my skills and make me more desirable in an industry outside the ivory tower?Thanks for your help!
d0z9gv	1567879058	241	I am going a hard time at my workplace after telling my employer I'm pregnant. On top on the exhaustion and other uncomfortable symptoms of pregnancy, my morale is very low and I feel I'm about to burnout at the office because my manager is very unsupportive and it's making things harder for me, for example, he denies me time off and work-from-home days and puts a lot of pressure on me/blames me when the business is going bad.My due date is February 28th of 2020.At my workplace the holiday week from Dec 24 to Jan 1 is off for everyone as the office is closed and I'm supposed to take my unused 3 weeks vacation before going on mat leave. I want to combine the holiday week with my 3 weeks unused vacation and start my mat leave right after so I can stop working as soon as Dec 24 instead of the usual 3 weeks before my due date. I'm afraid my manager is not going to approve it because I'm combining a lot of paid time off in sequence and leaving 2 months before my due date. I don't know how to explain this to HR without sounding like I only want to take advantage of our time off policies. I honestly feel the environment at my workplace is hurting me and just want to have a rest from it because the birth of my baby.Any advice is appreciated!
cyys0u	1567477488	182	I work as a mental health therapist.  I am attempting to open up a private practice but it is not going well (not sure why).  Anyway I dont know if this is more compassion fatigue or burnout or if I'm just done, but im just not feeling this anymore.  I've been working in human services since 2008 and been a therapist since 2012 and I hate the shit pay, the worry towards paperwork/clients, and the past couple of jobs I've had have not been great and just the overall stress.  I dont know what else I could get into though since I've worked so long in this (i would like to try to not have much of a pay cut since I have a kid and am the primary bread winner of my family).  I just feel like at this point any goals we have are not gonna be achieved like getting a house, paying some shit off, hell even getting our kid the best opportunities we can.  Any help would be great because I'm just lost.
cyvm8u	1567461009	280	Graduated in 2017 from a Big-10 school in Econ/pre-med, attended med school for 2 semesters then withdrew, took Biology classes at local state school for 2 semesters considering Biology phd. Took some time off this summer and am currently studying for the GRE. I wasn't super passionate about the medical school material as I desired a deeper understanding, I also am not the fastest learner so I would often spend 10-12 hours studying per day which quickly leads to burnout. Recently became aware of healthcare consulting and feel that is a career I'd be very passionate about. It seems to combine healthcare, business, and technology with the ability to work as part of a team to solve meaningful problems. The 50-60 hour work weeks are also preferable to medicine as I would have time to explore other interests rather than delaying that for at least 7 years. Paying off student loans ASAP is another top priority. Any tips on how to quickly break into the field? I'll be able to get a referral from a friend at a Chicago firm but not sure if this is enough since I have no relevant experience. Most of my experiences are healthcare oriented (RA at Neuroscience lab, ER Scribe, volunteer at free clinic, internship with UAEM). I was also on the executive board for a few student organizations and hope this helps since firms seem to value leadership. I understand the job search will likely take a while; any recommendations on how to spend this time learning and/or gaining relevant experience? Any other factors I should be considering? **TL/DR: I have an Econ degree + healthcare experience and want to get into healthcare consulting**
cv751j	1566730645	624	 Hello Reddit world!This might be a throwaway account, depending on the responses:Thank you for having me. I am transitioning out of the social work field due to my license being capped by the state I reside in. I am looking to start a job that is willing to pay me to train me and then retain me. My goals are simple, financial stability, with the option to work remotely. I would love to travel and work from wherever I am at. I did quite well in school and have graduated from a social work masters program (3.91) and was part of an internal nonacademic program in graduate school as well (also on my diploma only reason why I state it). I know employers don't care so much,I am just trying to paint a better picture. I am quite social but am ok with not taking a social job also (or being one on one is ok) (especially for being an INFJ), and I took a career assessment test. I tested the highest in CRE. Conventional, realistic, and Entrepreneurial. I have a budding following on Linkedin, and my successful entrepreneurial friends obviously want me to start a business as well. That is at step zero currently because I want to partner and be part of an employer or something stable. But I am quite interested in having a company be interested in me and interested in training me. Where I live, there is a huge healthcare sector with medical device companies, and some IT. I am not picky about what I do, as long as I am not pressured by time to finish something. I take a little bit longer to process complex ideas, but do quite well once I know.Computer systems analyst, technical support specialist, life insurance agent, sales manager, auditor, computer programmer, and technical sales representatives came up also as the top jobs, with medical sales also in the top fields. I understand finance quite well and can sell. I have a knack for selling, but that just seems like high pressure, if suddenly businesses didn't want the product. B2b sales are what I hear is good. I am partnering up with an employer company where they help get you jobs, however, they keep sending me social work jobs. And I am switching out of that industry. My skills and knowledge will obviously be used in whatever field because that is something I know. I think like an engineer as well and think with pictures. So A to B=C. That makes sense to me. I want a job that will train me on the job and is a relaxed and non-stressful environment. I am interested in not ever having to take a test or study again. I need a break from school and having to take a test or else you can't be a licensed type of job. That gives me anxiety (along with everyone else probably who do that).I read about HR, and criminal justice and that just seems quite draining. So I am perfectly ok with not being in a field close to social work (it is a burnout field and so stressful). I have learned that the funding source is what determines your paycheck. And it is as bad as everyone says with not getting paid much. I should have listened sooner. But I digress. I am a career woman also (I am CF too, because well sex and doing whatever I want is just way more fun for me than raising kids in my opinion).So Reddit people please pm me if you have advice on my career. I am interested to hear. Thank you. Also please don't solicit me to join services or programs that cost money. Thank you.
cv337d	1566701236	368	I’m 31, I taught overseas for several years and came back to get my degree.. My BA is in English and Art, and I got a masters in TESOL last year.  I thought I’d be a TESOL teacher, but after flunking my student teaching and burning out as a substitute, I’ve been trying to figure things out. My state is making it impossible to get my certification. The only job I can get is subbing, and only subbing jobs in my field count towards my certification. I cannot be hired as a long term sub without certification. Even if I had it, I’d prob still be struggling w burnout. There are a lot of things I don’t miss about teaching/subbing. My plan was to go teach overseas again but I can’t go atm due to health reasons. I thought I had things figured out, but all I know now is what I don’t wantI’m currently a part time freelance writer at a marketing/content mill. I’ve always loved writing, and want to expand it. I also want to start tutoring (pref not through VIP KID) just to make some money, I’m temping at an office job right now and it’s so hard to make ends meet.I worry about being able to make a career and having opportunities for advancement. But I know I’d regret it if I didn’t try to work for myself. I just don’t know what to do. My family is so pissed I failed my certification and that I still don’t have it. Most of my family is teachers. They’re mad but I’m even more pissed at myself.I’m in my 30s and all I see around me are people who are moving up in their careers, or buying houses, or just being successful. I feel like such a failure. I dream of working in a coworking space, or buying a van to travel in, and I’m so broke right now I can’t ever imagine doing those things. I can’t even get hired as a fucking teacher despite my degree and experience, that’s how much I suck. I have skills I just need to make them pay the bills (and start feeling better). Idk. Thanks for reading.
cu9ndf	1566539397	579	When I was young I wanted to be a pediatrician then I found out how long it takes to become one and I hate school so I decided to look for something else. I went to college thinking of doing pharmacy but then I did really bad my first semester and become scared bc the classes would only get harder from there. My school offered public health which I found so interesting but the job outlook didn’t look so good. Then I thought of healthcare management/informatics and I found it interesting as well but after research a lot of people were saying that they couldn’t find a decent entry level job. Also I read a lot of people who go into health care admin are nurses or have backgrounds in the hospital or business. So I became stuck. Then I thought of being a nurse Practitioner because it is similar to a doctor but less schooling. But I would have to get my bsn first. Which I thought wouldn’t be bad. But I’m struggling with finding nursing schools that will accept me with my 2.8 gpa. Also I was thinking about how I would see my self in the future and know that I don’t want an extremely stressful job. I know life can get stressful sometimes, trust me but I want good stress. Not the type of stress where I hate my job and wish I never went that route, and I come home in a bad mood. I’ve read a lot about nurses hating their jobs and burnout and know that I don’t want that to be me. I like to help people but I hate the feeling of knowing that a person’s life is in my hands or making a mistake, it terrifies me. Part of me wants to go the nursing route bc it can help me get a health admin/informatics job but I don’t know if I can last in bedside nursing considering everything I’ve been hearing. If there was a way I could never do bedside nursing and go into health admin, informatics,Research, or Case management I would but I know it requires experience.Or maybe an office nurse might not be so bad for me. I just recently started looking into aesthetics because I love skin care but I know that pay isn’t really good.That brings me to now almost in my junior of undergraduate and still undecided. I’ve sat down to think about things that I love and find interesting. -I like to help and inform people- I love beauty, makeup, skincare- I like making and creating things like if there was such thing as a makeup engineer lmao-I love watching makeup reviews and influencers on YouTube - I like math but not really hard math lol-I’ve always wanted to own a business but I don’t know what I want for the business-I like office jobs and structure to my life/job, I don’t like not know what to expect when I come into work(gives me anxiety)-I’m more of a type B personality So basically I’m just torn between what career to pursue in life. I want decent pay (75k+) but I don’t want to hate my job or have high stress. I would love a health care job in the office or little to no direct patient care. Or a nursing job that’s not bedside. Do I have job luck with health admin/informatics with just a bachelors? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

cqphtw	1565874020	161	Let me clarify, I am highly skilled in fields I really don't really like. Now, theoretically, there's no reason to ever have to use these skills in most job positions....but let's say, I included samples of my works in skills I personally don't like, because they have to demonstrate my writing ability for example, in order to apply to a job that mostly uses entirely different sets of skills.But now that my potential employers (or my actual employers) know about these other skills of mine, I ***fear*** they may wish to make use of such skills. Yeah, it's not entirely rational. I wonder if I have burnout from overusing such skills in different jobs before.What do I do if they do ask I use such skills? Do I just demand a raise/a higher salary until the (probably not entirely rational) pain of having to use these skills are compensated by what I feel is adequate compensation?Is there anyone else with similar experiences?
cpzoff	1565731441	298	I currently work as a high school teacher and am slowly coming to the realization that this is **not** what I want to be doing my whole life. Every time there is a training or a meeting that has to do with "how we can help and service students" I find my heart isn't in it. When they talk about being sensitive and empathetic to students' needs and wants, how we should "be a champion" for the students, and how we should "go above and beyond" for them, my heart isn't in it and, on the worst days, I find myself saying "I just don't care". That's not fair to the kids and I find myself having a mid-quarter life crisis. I've been in education for 8 years and teaching for about 4; I've been told I'm good at it, but that teacher burnout has started to really get to me. As silly as it sounds, my dream job is something where I sit in an office and work from 9-5. Not having to deal with students, admin, and other teachers really sounds ideal to me. I recently got into curriculum writing for my school (it is stipend based so it comes so sparingly) and I found I **love it**, but there are no positions open to do it full time. I enjoy going home and writing curriculum; I enjoy the quiet time, and I really enjoy dissecting the standards and writing something I know will be used.  Are there any other jobs out there where I can do something like that? I'm open to any field, taking more classes, and going for more schooling. I've just been in education for so long I feel that I don't know what else there is besides "doctor", "lawyer", or "engineer".
cpzdbk	1565730119	319	tl;dr* I have no interest in working restaurant. however I want to get managerial experience.* I getting myself burnout from working Hospitality, and applying jobs for Web Dev position* I want to do something that is more office oriented that involves number crunching / inputting data on Excel.I've been working in Hospitality industry (specifically restaurants) for the past five years. However, I made zero career progression for the past five years, which is a big *red flag*. There are some things that I would like to point out, before starting: * I have zero interest in Hospitality industry, however it is something that I am frankly quite good at (in terms of menu knowledge, up-selling items, attentiveness towards guest tables (such as: filling up drinks, changing plates, etc...).* I have no formal education. My highest education at this very moment is only a high school diploma.* I am self-taught web developer; however been getting nearly 0.1% response rate from +800 resumes that I have sent over the past 2 years, and got 0.1% response, I got 0% job offers. To the point where I am burnout, and started to lose interest in it.Some things that I would like to accomplish (short term):1. Get managerial experience. My current assistant manager, has no prior hospitality experience asides from an year hospitality training and an year of internship which equates to 2 years relevant experience towards the industry.2. I would like to transition to a more office oriented work, due to my technical background from countless hours that I spent on Udemy in teaching myself web development.3. Learn more about, a day-to-day job of a data analyst and the minimum requirements for job entrance.Ideally, I would like to work with spreadsheets in number crunching the numbers and create a daily / weekly / monthly / annually report back to the company. Couple of things that I came in mind was:* Data Analyst* Bookkeeping
cphpqj	1565640077	469	I have a masters in comp sci, and I've been working in tech for 4 years. I went into the gaming industry because my ultimate dream is to write my own game engine and make games, but I've since realized that while I enjoy coding in my spare time, I can't stand doing it as a career. I'm just not fast enough (and don't grow fast enough) for the corporate environment. And now that I'm looking for a job again, I'm not having much luck with interviews. My resume attracts people, and I've been through some on-site interviews, but haven't landed a job yet.&amp;nbsp;**Goals:*** Pay off student debt* Build a tiny house on wheels* Live in a different part of the country for 10 months out of the year, spend 2 months near family, rinse/repeat* Program my game engine in my off-time* Work a normal job (freelance? remote?) during normal work hours**Finances:** * 10K in a 401K* ~20K in student debt* 1-2 months rent money left until I'm broke	*No other debt**Living situation:*** Single, 1 awesome dog* 1 Roommate (also has a dog)	**Current total monthly expenses: $2700**(includes rent, food, minimum on student loans, health insurance, etc)&amp;nbsp;So I need to figure out my next step. Money to pay my rent and start paying down my student debt seems like a good place to start. Here are some options I've considered:* Continue looking for a high-paying tech job. In the meantime, find a low-wage job (beertender at a local brewery or something similar) to keep paying rent. Once I land the tech job, suffer through that until I pay off my student debt. Then find a job I enjoy that will allow me enough time to make games on the side.	* Find a low-wage job, but try to build a freelance/remote business in my spare time?	* Move to a lower cost of living area somewhere else in the country, and try to find a job?* Move back to the midwest to live with my parents who have offered to take me in rent-free for roughly half a year. They've also offered to help pay off some of my student debt (I don't like the idea of anyone else paying for my debts, but they're not hurting for money and it is an option). Either find a tech job there and settle down near home, or find a job in a different city, and move again.&amp;nbsp;	I've been trying to look at other high-ish paying positions that could utilize my degree without being a programmer, but I haven't found much. Maybe I'm just not looking in the right places? Should I just try and go into a trade and be an electrician or something? Curious if there are other options overall that I'm not considering, or if there are other things I should think about.
cnur1s	1565311249	421	Hello! As the title suggests, I love learning about other cultures and immigrant/refugee experiences and sharing that knowledge with others, but I am approaching teacher burnout and curious about how I can apply my strengths and interests in a different way. Interests: I love helping people in need and seeing the impact of my work. The best parts of my job are sitting with kids and their families and helping them understand all the crazy nuances and cultural differences in American life, helping them with “real-world skills” (job applications, giving a presentation, etc), and managing a caseload of students (keeping track of everything about them from their grades, to their social issues, to their home lives). I make great connections with my students and keep in touch with many of those who have graduated. My desk is littered with thank you cards and small gifts from students and families, and many coworkers have said I am a great addition to the different schools I’ve worked at over the years due to my passion and genuine care. I love to travel and am interested in languages. That all being said, I hate formal teaching. I’m not good at planning lessons, or teaching kids how to write, nor do I care about assessments or grades. I am often supporting other subjects in a co-teaching setting where I have very little say over what happens, and often lack passion in the subject being taught. I thought I felt this way due to inexperience, but 5 years in and hours of professional development later (that I pursued out of my own choice and paid for myself), I still hate these things that are at the core of teaching (on the other hand, I LOVE PD about religions, multicultural literature, human rights issues, diversity training, etc). Writing this out is the first time I have realized just how much I don’t want teaching to be my career. I have tried different grade levels and school districts, but in my heart, I really hate the “teaching” part of teaching. I’ve worked in an international student recruiting role and did not like the “sales” aspect of the job, but am interested in other roles, either in or outside of the school setting, where I could be immersed in supporting a multicultural population. I have a BS in Accounting in addition to a Masters in Education, but I would consider going back to school if I needed another certification to start a career I liked better. Any suggestions? Thank you!
cns0m9	1565298297	388	Hi, I'm currently working as a Social Worker (have my Master's). It is a field where burnout is a real risk and I probably don't want to do this forever. In fact, I've been feeling the stress already, but I think I have a few years left in me yet.I'm thinking about branching out to a new field maybe 1-15 years down the line, which is to say basically whenever I feel like a change is needed. Luckily I believe Social Work is actually just a set of skills that work well in any number of fields and workplaces.What I'm thinking about doing is putting some time aside every week when I'm not working to learn a new skill or two to help me make that change. I just don't know what to learn that will a) prove potentially useful career-wise, and b) I can teach myself / attend workshops here and there (I don't think returning to school is for me at this point).I'm fairly techy and used to enjoy programming when I was younger, but also enjoy working with people to improving their lives (obviously) and maybe changing society in general instead of putting band-aids on individual issues. I'm also fairly good with personal finance management - I get a lot of comments about how I invest my money and finding ways to cut down on expenses without impacting quality of life. I even thought about going into economics and computers in university, but I'm fairly weak with math unfortunately. Food, music, TV, movies, video games are all things I enjoy and I'm probably a lot more knowledgeable with these topics than the average person (likely not to be of great help finding jobs though). I love the great outdoors too (especially hiking) and basically all the money I have either goes into long-term savings or travel fund. If traveling around the world is a viable career I'd be doing that in a heartbeat.So again, If I could take some time every week to learn a new skill or two in preparation for a career change eventually, what might be something (or different options) I can really look into to focus my time on so I can potentially have another career trajectory to start on when the time comes for me to change from this one? Thanks!
cncvti	1565217846	239	I've been working at my current position for about 7 months. We are in the midst of a large-scale transition from an in-house system onto a very customized instance of Salesforce. I've been working as the sole team member on their Marketing and Digital Messaging Team, but I'm contemplating leaving the company because I'm starting to get burned out.&amp;#x200B;I'm currently the only person in the IT department that works on a team of their own and, since I've been building out tons of custom features with absolutely zero time for documentation, it's almost impossible to imagine someone coming in and taking over immediately. &amp;#x200B;The workload has been intense in order to meet our go-live and I've got no one else to turn to for help. I've requested more resources, but the company is unable to pull anyone else into my sphere since all the teams are struggling to finish against this aggressive deadline and can't take the down-time associated with training.&amp;#x200B;Is there any possible way I could make this work so that I'm not burning every single bridge at the company? My leaving will ensure we don't meet our legal (or most business) requirements for the go-live, so it's going to get escalated immediately to the executive team. I love my boss and the company, but there is not an end to burnout on the horizon and I've gotten some offers recently that are extremely tempting. &amp;#x200B;Any advice is appreciated!
cnbkvl	1565211590	558	Hi. A bit of background:   I have just finished my undergraduate degree in brain sciences with a decent but not perfect GPA and a bit of research/extracurriculars. I'm at the stage where I need to be registered for a test (GRE, MCAT, LSAT) and begin the application process to graduate school. I have given myself an entire month of leisure time to see if anything will come to mind, but I haven't been able to decide upon a "next step" in my career. Here are the pieces I'm working with right now: 1. I don't really have any inclination to be a lawyer, but I love studying for the LSAT. I've looked at the GRE and MCAT and they look so dry and exhausting.  I took a practice LSAT with no prep, proper time constraints and got a 160. I really like the problems and I could do them for fun every day. 2.  I want to have a decent income, at least 100k or above. I will not settle for less.3. Enjoyment is important to me, it's almost a curse. I need to be enjoying what I'm doing. I Have a good work ethic and can work away at something for hours but only if it's something I truly care about or see the point of.4. I'm definitely a people person. I love helping people and working with them, but I'm sensitive so helping people *all the time* can be very exhausting. 5. My background is in science. I have experience studying in research labs, doing data analysis, running statistics, and conducting experiments. I have basic knowledge of image analysis and some mathematica/python. I find data analysis to be fun and rewarding but I am nowhere near qualified to be a data scientist. 6. I'm a good writer. I have taken many English classes where I have received perfect scores and I truly do enjoy those classes. 7. I'm very conscientious. I want the career I do to have a positive impact. I couldn't work for a big company that's screwing people over or anything that's entirely selfish. I care about the environment. 8. I'm creative. Knowing all of this, I cannot pick a good career path. I could be a therapist because it's rewarding, and I'm a people person, but the pay isn't good enough and I'm afraid I'd become VERY emotionally exhausted. I could go into neuroscience or computational neuroscience but again the pay isn't optimal and I'm not *exceptionally* skilled at computational neuroscience research to devote 5 years to a phd. I could go to law school, but it seems dry and boring. While I may be able to excel in the material, I don't know how much I actually care about the *law.* I'm an existential person so it feels weird to devote my life studying something that is manmade, and inadvertently being a cog in the prison industrial complex / judicial system. I'm also nervous that the stress could lead to burnout very fast. I don't know why exactly, but having worked with science and numbers for my undergrad, it feels almost weird to live a life completely devoid of them. I'm still weighing my options, but I'm running out of time and I'm unable to find clarity. Any help would be greatly appreciated and thank you very much.
cm1pqk	1564953259	441	Hi all. I work in the arts marketing industry, which is difficult to crack into as an entry level marketer. I have now been in the industry for 3 years with my first “real” post college job. I am having difficulty staying on top of my work and I’m not sure why. I think that I’m suffering from a combination of burnout and horrible communication from higher up management. Things have been chaotic since I started. A natural disaster hit my first year. Our CEO was “asked” to resign by our board. We didn’t have a CEO for basically a year. The new one isn’t great as they don’t communicate what they are looking for, micromanage everyone in the company and rarely get materials that need to be approved back promptly. My first manager was fired for not doing their job. My second manager was let go. My director has horrible communication skills. And to top it all off, I am basically a marketing/social media/public relations/events manager, which means I have a multitude of tasks that have become overwhelming because I am basically a one person team. I was promoted as my last manager was laid off because I had been doing all of the work anyways. It was great except I became exempt and was worked endlessly for months because there was no cap on my hours. At one point, I had worked 28 days straight. Currently, I am supposed to have a new manager start next month and had an interim one start earlier this summer. The interim person has not been much help. They were gone on vacation for a good chunk of the summer, work remotely on most days and I never know when they’ll be in the office. I feel as though I never know what work I need to be working on, I am constantly behind and every day contains small fires that I need to put out.I don’t trust that the new manager is going to truly be better than the rest. I also feel like I’m stuck and can’t learn anything more from this job.Needless to say, my mental health is suffering. I want to call in sick for a mental health day, but I can’t because of the workload. If I miss one day, all hells breaks loose. I have cried every week for the past month.I love the arts. I love marketing. And I want to stat in this industry, but there are no arts marketing jobs currently open in my city. I feel so stuck.Is it time to just say goodbye to my blossoming arts marketing career or tough it out?
cln348	1564862328	325	I've been working full-time at a non-profit for a year as its communications and development director, and I started off as a volunteer six months before that. While working full-time there, I've seen a programs director come and go with no replacement and her work was expected to be picked up by an unpaid intern as well as by me and another colleague. We're now losing our volunteer and intern coordinator who handles all things hiring and onboarding in addition to other administrative tasks in two weeks and again, there's no plan to replace her.The expectation is for me to pick up all of her HR work, which she estimates takes up 30 hours of her week. I'm already doing two peoples' jobs in my role as well as some extra pieces from the detritus of my other colleague's absence. My executive director won't lift a finger for operations work.I've honestly been on the verge of burnout as is -I've had a flare up of a chronic health problem and have been experiencing anxiety I've never had before in my life -and have been looking for another job for some time. Having to take on my colleague's job on top of my heavy loads will drown me. Oh, and the overall environment is toxic, which I've been doing my best to cope with, but can't anymore. What do I do?I don't want to quit without another job lined up as I am afraid that if I do, I won't find another one. I came into this role with eight years of experience, but my career before now has been overseas and some of my work stints were for a year. I held the position before this for three years and never had trouble finding work over there. Am I unemployable if I quit this job?TL;DR Toxic work environment is driving me to quit but I'm really afraid to do so. Am I unemployable if I do?

cku0kt	1564692118	435	I'm a burnt out research scientist (quantitative / statistical / machine learning). I find it increasingly difficult to force myself to use my technical "skills", and at this point I don't know how to deal with the situation. Do I start over? Do I take time off? Do I just hang on and hope I eventually feel differently or save enough to retire? I want to regain motivation and joy in my career, and at the moment I feel completely lost.**Long version:**I got a PhD in a quantitative science. Although I did well enough (published a lot), I was unhappy throughout my PhD and during a subsequent postdoctoral position. Poverty &amp; academic politics were driving me nuts, so I left academia for a "machine learning research scientist" position at a tech company. I wasn't interested in tech, but I decided I'd "sell out" and try to focus on hobbies. Three years later, at age 35, I'm a "research scientist" at a second tech company. The past few years, I've really tried to de-emphasize my work and focus on my personal life &amp; hobbies (reading, writing, traveling, cycling, visual arts). But it's not working. I'm miserably unhappy in tech, and I have no idea what to do with myself now.Besides the money, I hate literally everything about this career. Although it seems I'm quite good at it, I'm just not interested in technology or engineering and never have been. I was motivated to do a PhD mostly by a passion for theory &amp; mathematics. I'm a capable engineer, but I find software and "making things work" dull and unsatisfying. The culture in tech is also a bad fit for me. I've been doing this for years and I have no friends in the field.I'm genuinely out of ideas for how to handle my situation. I feel completely burned out on my skillset. The mere idea of talking to someone about "data" or "neural networks" makes my stomach turn. I'm running on inertia at the moment, but I have trouble feigning interest or concern over my projects. I've tried applying to "transitional" jobs (I looked into data journalism, visualization, social science research), but when I've gotten to interviews I've had to acknowledge that I'm just uninterested in software &amp; technology.I feel pigeonholed by my skillset. Although in principle it opens doors for me into almost any field, I just don't want to write software or do science anymore, and I don't know how to explain that to people. I'm tired of solving puzzles. At the same time, "starting over" sounds exhausting, as does teaching or returning to academia.
cj8dlt	1564388573	382	I’ve been working in PR/marketing for around 5 years now. The past two years I’ve been working as a marketing manager on the client side, before that I did PR and copywriting on the agency side. I’ve been struggling with my career choice for a while now, wishing I had chosen something else. I’m fairly certain I want to go back to school for something entirely different.However, school for me wouldn’t be until early 2020 at the earliest, possibly not until summer 2020. I was planning on staying at my current job until then, and then taking a leave of absence for school.I’m just getting really burnt out with my current job and company. I had several months of sick leave because of burnout earlier this year, and after returning to work I worked part time for another few months because of my mental health. It’s a lot better now but I’m worried my job will push me back to that low point sooner or later.While on summer vacation, I started toying with the idea of moving abroad for a while. I lived abroad for much of my life but have been in my home country for almost a decade now. I speak several languages. My dream at the moment would be to quit my job in September/October (I have a lease on an apartment until October), then travel for a few weeks and then go to Berlin. Ideally I’d like to do freelance copywriting to get some kind of income for the time being, but I’m not really sure how to make that work and whether it’s feasible. I could talk to my old companies and old colleagues at least to see if they have any freelance/part time copywriting needs that I could do remotely?I have around 8k in savings that’s easily accessible, and around 5k that isn’t as readily accessible but for a worst case scenario. Would that be a good amount to get me on my feet to start trying out freelancing?TL;DR: Basically I’ve always been employed but want to try being more free for a while before going back to school sometime in 2020. I’m in marketing and would like to move abroad and make money by freelancing (copywriting mainly). What do I need to know to get started?
ci0sxa	1564134224	1191	Hello all,I have been working in software industry for more than 2 years now. I graduated with MechE degree 3 years ago. I took an extra year to graduate ( so I was supposed to graduate 4 years ago ), since I failed a course and decided to utilize that to have an extra year so that I can took additional courses from CS department. At that point I was sure I wanted work as a software engineer, but not sure how to break into the industry. I passed additional courses with good grades, and had the chance to work at a start up for 6 months, where I actually learned most of the trade. After that I hit my first batch of toxic people. Most of the people convinced me at that point that I won't be able to get any software development jobs without an MSc degree in the field. So long story short I ended up quitting a research lab after months of work since one of the fellow students decided to set me up and told lies about me to the professor and professor became abusive towards me as time passes. I was liked by everyone (other MSc students, Phd students and all) and produced decent work there, and I quit myself because I couldn't handle the abusive behavior. I decided to look for alternatives and focused on projects rather than department and found a MSc in Physics, with a project on creating a simulation software for quantum computation research. I got admitted with full scholarship, to find out after a year that the so called simulation software was just 10 lines of code in python and I was not getting the promised tuition increase since the project got cancelled. I quit academia then and there and decided to focus on finding a job since I was both emotionally and financially exhausted at that point.I started as a full time intern at a cloud provider company. I was immediately attacked by a fellow intern who has relatives in high places like parliament and ruling party in our country. This guy was openly threatening me based on his perceived ideas on my political ideology. I have never been a politically involved person, not that anything is wrong with it. This guy was really dangerous, even my boyfriend advised me to quit this place and even though I have reported him several times, nothing has happened and I found a full time software engineering job at a locally well known mid-sized start up and quit after 5 months.At this place I received no tasks at all. Seniors there forced me to carry coffee for them, do menial work even though we have a helper lady whose job was to do those. I was constantly blocked by my senior and manager from taking tasks upon myself from the kanban board. The promises my manager gave were never becoming true, and in fact most of them were getting cancelled one by one. After my 5th month, founder of the company came and announced that we are in economical recession officially. At that point I was exhausted already, I was just showing up for work and getting money at the end of the month. One day I saw an opening ay my current company and just applied with nothing in my mind.I got hired after 3 weeks I applied and started immediately. My team was newly setup, most of us juniors or recent graduates with no enterprise experience before. For the last year we had to deal with an imposter colleague who lied her way into second level engineering position where in fact she cannot even code a single line. Her mental problems were constantly getting in our way doing our job (she is constantly distracted and lying), she delayed work on purpose all the time and had no ability to organize ideas or work. After a year mark she kind of lost it and started to lie to people in other teams that we as a team mobbing her, and manager then had to remove her from her tasks and put a senior from another team to lead our work. Now at this point half of my team already stopped producing any work and become brutes. These two guys are now pressuring who is producing work and trying to do something decent with their career into not doing anything. Mind that these colleagues are simply doing their pet projects at office or doing leet code challenges in groups for their next company.I am simply sick of dealing with so much toxicity. I don't even want to change companies because I believe nothing will ever change at another company. These people are everywhere. I feel depressed, extremely tired and cannot focus on my work anymore. During meetings I got berated like a child by my juniors in age no matter how well I defend my position, these people have an unshakable confidence in themselves, that nothing will ever happened to them even though they are practically frauds.I am happy where I am in life in terms of career.  I worked my a.. off to get here. I have survived through so much to get here. I am not going to let my career get destroyed or slowed down by couple of idiots. I have achieved so far than anyone had told me before without an official degree. I am liked and respected by my manager and senior colleagues. The issue is my team. It is always the people I work in close proximity that turns out to be toxic which is draining after so much exposure.Is there any skill that I should be developing dealing with this much toxicity ? I am open to my manager about what I experience and what is happening and how it affects me. Also the new team lead seems to be aware of what is going on now and closely following people who are doing no work. I came in do my work, attend meetings, do my best and leave. However except one colleague, non of the remaining 4 is doing anything, or not doing it properly which results in more and more work for me.I am not saying everyone is out there to get me, it is nothing like that, I am saying that I am working with toxic, selfish    and entitled people, and they seem to be everywhere I go. There doesn't seem to be a workplace where the major source of stress is work itself rather than office politics and all the gossip.I feel exhausted, started to have trouble sleeping and focusing on my work. I decided to take a long vacation. I am wrapping things up for the follow up when I leave, and leaving 10 days later. I really need some advice on how to handle toxicity in workplace and how to not let it to get me when it is all over the place shouting at my face daily. I just want to return back with some new ideas, or a strategy to deal with all this.
cgxytt	1563913560	387	Figured I’d give a small back ground in my current career field before getting into the main topic. I am currently 23 years old and have worked in EMS all of my adult life. I obtained my EMT at 17 and volunteered until I was 18 and could get my first job. I went on to obtain my paramedic by 20 along with an associates degree in the respective field. In total I’ve got about 6 years of field experience at varying levels and commitment, and I never imagined when I first got into the line of work I would consider a career change. This obviously isn’t the case or I wouldn’t be writing this. There’s many contributing factors to my change, and I know burn out is prevalent in this line of work, but I am strongly considering ceasing public safety work. I should also make the statement that my mental health is fine, I am NOT suicidal, and anything I may have seen does not effect my day to day life. I have always been intrigued with computers from the software stand point and have recently, due to my thoughts of career change, considered this to be a potential new career. I was hoping to get some first hands experience with individuals currently in a software field. If there is anyone reading this that works in development or security I am highly interested in these aspects of software. I am curious as to what your standard working hours are like, is there options to work from home, and what is the first steps I need to take as far as education goes. I also know that math is involved with software, but I’m curious as to just how advance the mathematics are as I have struggled in the past. I’m also curious to hear from anyone still in the EMS field if they at any point experienced similar considerations to my current, and what they ultimately decided to do. I’d like to hear if someone thinks this is a small burnout phase and there is something they would suggest for me to do so I could feel the same as when I initially began the career. I’d like to think anyone in advanced who replies to this post or message me, I appreciate the assistance/guidance offered.
cgfr9o	1563814557	824	Hello all,&amp;#x200B;Currently working remotely as a data analyst for a large fortune 500 company for the last year. I've been at this company my entire working career (moved up from the bottom over 8 years ago).&amp;#x200B;When I first started this job I wasn't trained well, or at all if I'm being honest. Most of the training revolved around watching my supervisor complete requests which wasn't too beneficial and/or me figuring things out for myself. Originally he'd give me something to work on and test me a bit. This helped a lot because if I wasn't able to figure something out on my own then he'd help me work through it but this kind of 1 on 1 has drastically reduced since. We mostly work with VBA, Excel, and Access with the occasional SQL query sprinkled in. I thought I'd be learning how to use SQL more often as well, since I was required to complete some courses on it, but this has not been the case. On top of that the work flow is very irregular. I'd say about 50% of the time I've had nothing to do so I've been trying to complete training courses online to better myself or just redditing/etc to make time pass. Occasionally my supervisor will reach out and ask me to create a database/report. Sometimes I can figure it out, other times I feel completely lost and utterly hopeless in completing the task. If I have trouble pulling the data (which is usually the case because the data is available in a variety of sources... I feel like I never know where to find anything) or if I can't figure out how to complete a report then he'll help me through it but... it's like pulling teeth with the guy. My supervisor is a nice guy but he seems like a very messy and disorganized person. Most of the time when I send him an email/message he doesn't respond or will respond days later. I've asked him a couple of times now on how he thinks I'm doing and what I can improve on. I keep getting the "I think you're doing a good job, just keep it up; this job has a huge learning curve". I'll feel okay for a bit but then get tasked to work on something that I can't figure out and my anxiety skyrockets as I feel imposter syndrome creeping back in. &amp;#x200B;On top of that, there's one manager who knows me from previous jobs at the company. Once he found out that I got this position, he started making all kinds of requests directly to me. This began in the first couple months, which almost drove me to quit because it basically felt like heckling, then tailored off for a bit after my supervisor intervened by telling him that all requests must go through him. Since then there's still been numerous instances where this manager has sent me requests on the side. When I tell my supervisor he just says "oh sounds like you've got some work to do". On top of that, I usually can't figure out how to pull what he needs or present it in a way he likes. Most of the time I have to contact my supervisor for help which again turns into a game of tag where he either doesn't respond or gives me a vague response on what to do instead of taking the time to work with me on these requests. These constant requests from this guy make me feel like his own personal secretary because he's always pressuring me to get the requests done right away (even though they're not hot items most of the time), regardless if I'm working on something my supervisor gave me (this manager is in a different group btw and does not outrank my boss).&amp;#x200B;I feel like I've been given a great opportunity because my work/life balance is amazing right now with working from home. However, I absolutely despise what I'm doing and feel like I'm not cut out for it. I feel like I haven't learned a whole lot in the past year and just feel generally lost/hopeless. When Sunday rolls around I start to feel like shit knowing I have to work the next day. I'm also worried because I feel like I don't have the skills necessary to perform this role at other companies since I'm already struggling working here. Burnout is definitely real as I don't even care about my work anymore. I used to get the "aha" feeling when I figured something out but now I find myself just hoping that nothing breaks/no requests come in so I can just do nothing and be anxiety free.&amp;#x200B;Is this a normal work atmosphere in this profession or am I being too hard on myself? Does anyone else feel this kind of pressure/anxiety in these types of roles?&amp;#x200B;Any suggestions on what I can/should do at this point?
cf04qo	1563493456	161	I began looking for new employment recently and just landed a job relevant to my degree.  I do not wish to give advanced notice to my current employer due to hostility issues with my immediate supervisor. Also I need a poor-man's vacation desperately as I'm fighting burnout.  I would like to explain the real reason I am leaving to the CEO (with documents supporting), but I fear the consequences of actually burning this bridge.  I have two previous supervisors who would and have provided stellar references in place of this one. I don't want to leave on a lie, but would feel little remorse if I had to. When resigning and providing a letter, do I actually need to give a reason?  Can I type a cordial letter and a "It was nice working with you"-style handshake?  I apologize if this is difficult to read. My brain is a bit scattered from the new-job high. Thanks everyone.
ce5r00	1563324640	329	Hi. I posted something similar to this in /r/3DModeling but didn't get any comments so I'm hoping to get some advice here.  &amp;#x200B;I'm 30 and in need of a career change. The career I'm in right now is not a good fit and I'm in the midst of a massive burnout. I'm interested in improving my self taught 3D modeling skills for a career change but am not sure what field to go into. I've been 3D modeling for the past 6 years to 3D print small sculptures/jewelry as a hobby. I like VFX but it doesn't seem to be a realistic option for me with the high competition and the work centric lifestyle. The career I'm in currently is also a highly competitive creative field and I can't handle something similar. I'm looking for a steady practical field that uses 3D modeling, preferably more free form modeling rather than hard surface CAD but am not sure what those fields are.    &amp;#x200B;So far I'm thinking I could improve my Rhino/Matrix skills to get a job modeling jewelry, since I know a bit about jewelry making already. Or I could study and be a dental lab tech to model prosthetics. Or should I focus on improving my CAD skills to widen my options? If so, in which field? Every article about growing job prospects seem to mention the use of 3D but I'm having a hard time finding specific job titles.  &amp;#x200B;I've also started to study web development/programming as another option since there seems to be better job prospects. I like it so far but am not sure how realistic it would be to turn this into a career since I'm a total beginner. Should I focus my study on this instead and keep the 3D modeling as a hobby? Is this a career that will let me have some free time on the side to continue my hobby?&amp;#x200B;Please give me any advice/suggestions/reality checks. Thank you.
ccy5pc	1563073502	451	I'm an arts administrator for a large ballet company looking to make a career change, but I have no idea what would suit my unusual and very niche skillset. I'm currently a full-time Company Manager, which means I'm responsible for making sure 40-65 professional ballerinas have all the support they need to give their best performances: managing schedule information; dealing with sick leave, complaints, soft-HR stuff; managing internal communications (a lot of emails, briefings, tour information booklets, etc.) It's a desk job, but one which needs a lot of industry knowledge. I'm scared because my whole career has been in the arts - I have a Bachelor of Theatre Arts (Management) and have never worked outside the industry. I want to make a change because funding is severely limited and while my job is secure, I'm never going to make even the national median wage, let alone enough for financial independence like my wife and I want. I love what I do, but it's a 24/7 kind of job due to how we work and nobody gets paid enough for the stress.&amp;#x200B;Key skills are: project planning, project management, creating/managing schedules, budgets and drafting contracts. Some HR skills, but it's not something I want to do for a job. Strong written and verbal communication skills necessary due to large number of people I'm working with each day. Have an expert-level understanding of the arts &amp; culture industry, with career experience in non-profit and/or government-funded organisations (no private sector experience.)  I have worked in events management before. Some experience hiring and firing. Interests outside of work are being outdoors, working with young people (I'm a volunteer Scout leader), and books. What would you recommend?&amp;#x200B;I've also got experience in showcalling, which is managing all the lighting/sound/automation/cast/crew cues and movement on stage, live as the show happens over radio comms: I've been told I should consider air traffic control because of this - it's a hectic role where you're giving dozens of instructions per minute to a) keep everyone safe and b) keep the show running. Getting it wrong can result in a bad audience experience or someone getting killed if it really goes bad. Have also been told 911/emergency services dispatch would suit this kind of skill, but have heard that burnout rate is high. Anyone know of any jobs that require this kind of situational management experience?&amp;#x200B;Currently living in Australia, but American advice is usually quite relevant here! I would strongly consider going back and doing a masters degree to help with the change - so feel free to suggest. Also feel free to ask me anything about my current job! It's an awesome thing to do. (Have used a throwaway for privacy.)
cam99x	1562598661	431	I am keeping this vague because I have a public facing career. I work for a state university as a “field agent”. I’ve been in my current job for almost 5 years (as of October) and in that time I have added significantly to my job responsibilities and duties. I am now doing the work of two people (one of my coworkers retired and they handed me his work load and area assignment) plus a new assignment this year that has added 10-20 hours of work per week. My job is very amorphous and tends to be life-consuming. There is very little time that I can be completely away from work unless I am home and turn my phone off. I have evening meetings 2-4 nights a week and the occasional weekend in addition to covering a large geographic area. I am expected to be physically available in two offices as well as doing field work and attending many meetings with various agency partners. A large part of my job is designing educational programs and delivering them (along with all the logistics that accompany them) in addition to coordinating larger scale events and handling walk-in client questions. I largely enjoy most of the work that I do and I appreciate the flexible schedule, but...- I get very little support from the other office staff, even the ones who are in a “supporting” role. One of my coworkers has a superiority complex and acts like my supervisor even though she is not. She is constantly berating me for not doing enough in one office and yet has no idea what all I do. - I have not been given the pay increase I was promised for taking on additional duties.- I work long hours and am constantly pulled in so many directions that I am finding it harder and harder to stay focusedI am actively job searching and have had 4 interviews that went to the final stages but didn’t pan out. I am in a rural area with a specific field so it takes time due to limited options. How can I stay motivated and continuing doing a “good enough” job until I find something better? The stress is making my depression flare up and I am feeling so overwhelmed and burned out that I struggle to do basic tasks, much less create new programs and initiatives. TLDR; Job duties drastically increased and no support or resources to properly do job has left me burned out, depressed and overwhelmed. Looking for helpful suggestions on how to cope until find a new job.
c8ipn7	1562122191	141	I’m 23 and in my first full-time job, and know it’s not what I want to be doing forever or pursue advancing in it. I am a behavior technician for students with autism. I have a BA in psychology.In the past I’ve worked with English language learners, at risk children, college freshman on academic probation, and worked in my college’s office that handled accessible education/accommodations/tutoring. I’ve also worked in a veterinary office and in dog boarding/daycare settings.I enjoyed my office job the most, and academic coaching was a close second. The job I have now is way too chaotic for me. I don’t want to be a psychologist/counselor. I am frustrated and don’t know what to do next. I experience burnout easily but also want to be in a position to help others. Any ideas on what my next move should be?
c87lxy	1562063298	184	Currently, I’m teaching yoga for a living. I’ve been doing so for nearly a decade and I do love it at its core, but I’m experiencing the “yoga burnout”. I did more training last year to obtain my 500 hour RYT certificate with the plans of teaching students how to teach yoga, but those plans collapsed when the people I was planning on partnering up with gave up their yoga studio (due to issues with the landlord).Now, I’m at a loss. I’m thinking about taking the leap of a career change but I am at a complete loss of what to do. I found a part time job working at a library which is a fun gig, but it doesn’t feel like it’s meant to be my career. I have a few years of college experience but no degrees. I’m considering going back with a preference to online school. I’d like to focus on a degree that still involves helping people, the planet, or both. I’m not exactly sure what that is at the moment but I’m open to suggestions.Any advice is welcome. Thanks friends.
c4opye	1561386207	112	Need new exciting creative project every few weeks. Today I build a board game. Tomorrow I repair a trail. Next week I fight wildfires and brew kombucha. Any guidance?  Sounds silly but my work quality is better with passion and my passion for things comes in waves. I legitimately feel like I would be a better asset in this type of model. Hell, I’d go as far to say there is a workforce that could all band together - “150% Passion” - where we are jack of all trades. Stop the burnout and depression and keep workers interested. Serious question. I know it is “far fetched” because of societal norms...but any ideas?
c3v52i	1561239771	785	I graduated with a B.S. in biology three years ago with a 3.5 G.P.A (not great, not terrible). During my undergrad, I completed two Summer Undergrad Research Programs, successfully got a research award, and was active in my “mentor’s” lab. I was considering graduate school towards the end of my college career, but I kinda got burnt out(this burnout did not significantly impact my grades FYI).So I decided to go work in industry. I got a job straight out of college as a lab tech at an agricultural biotech company (as a contract worker) making 16$ an hour. Unfortunately, this job did not go very well. I was put to work doing automated, high throughput, mindless work that didn’t require any skill. High school dropouts could do it. It was manual labor with pipettes. Knowing that I needed to develop my skills beyond this type of work, I asked my superiors if I could assist in other projects to build up my lab skills. In response, they gave me the runaround. My boss said “If you want to improve your skills, try learning about the robot on your own.”Besides the fact that robotics isn’t my area of expertise, there wasn’t much of opportunity to learn since I didn’t have access to the manuals. I’ve been super cynical about biotech ever since. Everywhere I looked, the only job opportunities available were those offering the kind of automated, mindless, work I found super unsatisfying. So when my company didn’t renew my contract (they were merging with another company and laid off a ton of their own employees, in addition to not renewing my contract), I needed to find something else to do.My school psychologist fiancé suggested I go into teaching. So I applied and got accepted into a Master’s in Teaching program. To make money while in school, I decided to become a substitute teacher. Unfortunately, this was also a horrible experience. I aced my teaching classes, but I left the program because I had awful experiences as a sub. On top of that, it became clear that teaching was more about managing a classroom than helping students learn science.So now I need a new plan of action. I researched which jobs were seemingly a.) in demand and b.) jobs that required using one’s brain. Computer science seemed to fit the bill based on bureau of labor statistics. On top of that, I had taken 3 classes in my undergrad that involved coding, so it seemed like a natural choice. I had a B+ average in those classes, which isn’t great, but I was also taking upper level bio classes at the time. More importantly, I highly enjoyed these CS classes.The state university near me has a good computer science program (Iowa State). To prepare, I’ve been taking calculus classes online (which will transfer). Currently, I’m in calculus II and I’m doing really well. My current plan is to take Calc III in the fall and transfer over to ISU and begin taking classes in the spring.However, because I don’t want to make the same mistake again, I have continued to do research. Unfortunately, this research has given me some doubts about this career path too. For one, it seems that while employers are looking to hire more people, this demand ONLY seems to exist for people with a ton of experience. In other words, there are a ton of companies looking to hire senior developers, but no one on Earth is hiring entry level workers. I’ve contacted the CS program advisors at ISU and they tout a 95% placement rate after college, but this doesn’t necessarily reflect what the field will look like in 3 years. There are a ton of signs suggesting that the field is becoming over saturated with college graduates( just like biology).And if I hypothetically choose C.S. as my career path, there is the dilemma of choosing a specialization: software development, data science, cyber security etc. Of the specialization pathways, data science is the most appealing to me. And at Iowa State, data science is offered as a major. However, my research into this option has led me to believe this isn’t a very viable option either. Again, companies aren’t looking to hire green data science graduates. Obviously, I could help myself by interning somewhere(assuming I am able to get an internship).So yeah, I’m pretty demoralized right now. I am an extremely hard working and diligent person who wants to find work doing something meaningful that challenges me intellectually. It just seems like there aren’t any doors open for me there. I don’t want to accumulate more college debt if there aren’t any jobs on the other side.Please help! What should I do?
c2br3t	1560913658	199	So as the title says, I'm pretty fresh outta high school, about 3 weeks, and I'm having a lot of trouble laying down my future. The major roadblock for me is that it feels like I don't really have a lot of paths to pick from. I'm essentially what you'd call a screwup - I had a lot of opportunities to excel that I never took out of burnout and laziness. So I ended high schoo, with &gt;2.5 GPA, and a real lack of any marketable skills other than a high school diploma. IDK if all this is important tbh (probably is) but I'm adding it just in case.&amp;#x200B;My initial plan was to take a gap year to figure out what I want to commit to, and then head to community college and transfer out after that to a four year. But I'm stuck in a rut where I'm not sure what would be a good path for me to pursue. so I'm coming here for advice. The only preferences I really have are that they pay decently and don't involve hardcore maths (this is the one subject I'd say I really suck at). Just open to any suggestions atm.
c0x27e	1560603773	298	I got my GED and have not yet had the opportunity to go to college. I’m 22 and work at a healthcare call center. Luckily it’s more than automated calls and I know the work I’m doing is actually for the good of someone’s health! And of course with any call center and ANY job, customers can get nasty. I’ve gotten insulted and yelled at, complained to and about, and given just the general angry sighs and scoffs even when I’m being the nicest I can be and doing my job the best I can. My job does have a process if I’m dealing with “abuse” from callers, but I do struggle with PTSD and severe anxiety so sometimes it stresses me out for far longer than it should and I don’t follow the correct process of “end the call, document and contact supervisor, and move on to the next call unphased”.The thing is though I work from home which is especially good because over the past year I’ve been dealing with a lot of health issues. Working from home, making a few dollars above minimum wage, and working a 4x10s shift has helped tremendously in allowing me to treat me illnesses to the best of my ability and comfort. It feels like the goods outweigh the daily stress of overwhelming calls and annoying upper management. Is it best to just continue dealing with it and finding better ways to manage, or should I make a career move even if I’m unable to manage my physical health the way I can now.tl;dr My job situation is beneficial to my health and convenience, but it gets overwhelming day after day dealing with stress. Is it worth it or should I give up my good situation for less stress and burnout?
bze6wy	1560268380	261	I work in the healthcare industry (insurance carrier side) for one of the behemoths.  My team is small and dedicated to a growing market - Associations, PEOs (think Insperity, ADP Totalsource, etc).  I have an account that I handle that is very high touch and requires a ridiculous amount of detail-oriented work.  It is strategic while also being very high production.  The responsibility is great and my pay is not.  I’m paid $65k and that aligns with my title - but the amount of work and level of responsibility (approving multi-million dollar transactions daily) is more aligned to someone two slots above me (and about $20k above me).I have no backup.  So I went for a vacation but had to log in multiple days a week - the one week I managed to take 3 days, I came back to over 200 emails, many of them from people saying “hey, your backup said they wouldn’t have time to get to this.”I’ve begun to realize I actually dread PTO because it means more work and more people losing their minds about stuff that is “late”.I work from home and my days since about a year ago tend to be: wake up at 6:30, log in, work til 4:30 and then during busy season after putting kiddos down, head back down to work from 8:30 to 11-12.I just feel helpless and like I’m letting my wife and kids down because I’m so drained.TL:DR - think I may be experiencing burnout - anyone have “symptoms” I can watch for?
buhtdp	1559152165	590	I'm at a total loss at this point in my life, career wise, and need some advice.  I'm great with clerical tasks, love filling out paperwork, am a decent typist (75+ WPM), decent problem solver, and can answer phones professionally and efficiently.  I don't have the ultra conservative appearance that employers here like for their front-desk receptionists/secretaries though, so that probably is out of the question.  Data entry and records jobs here often require 3-5 years experience and are highly competitive to get into.I get along well with co-workers, am organized, and strive to make my employers happy.  I'd strongly prefer a job with little to no confrontation.  I have no desire to supervise anyone.  I basically would like a job where I show up on time, am given my tasks or already know what they are, do them well, where supervisors don't tend to micromanage/hover, have moderate levels of interaction with my co-workers and the public along the way, and then go home at night.I have an undergraduate degree in Crop Science, but no internship/post-degree training.  I have a graduate degree and credentials in education.  Also had an almost completed degree in Clinical Counseling before deciding it wasn't a good professional match due to my own anxiety (most of the patients in my internship were there for anxiety related psychotherapy services).I was a teacher for six years until the student violence and administrative micromanagement wore me down to the point of complete burnout.  While the anxiety has toned down a bit, I still have nightmares every now and then over some of the things I seen/encountered during those years.  Even though I always had stellar evaluations at the schools I taught at, I'd be just as happy never setting foot into another classroom again.  Since then I've had a position as a Level-One Computer Tech Support Rep and later as a certified Pharmacy Technician.  Computers/tech support field isn't my calling.  I am not interested or knowledgeable enough to provide adequate support for customers with more complex problems.  I felt completely out-of-place and inadequate working in that field.  As a Pharmacy Tech, I worked two separate retail positions which had extremely high numbers of people trying to fill controlled substance prescriptions.  They were some of the most stressful, obnoxious customers I've ever had to deal with.  Many were addicted to their painkillers and responded aggressively to any roadblock between them and their drugs.  I live in a state where you can work as a retail CPhT as long as you pass the exam, no extra education required.  Since I do not have a degree in the field, only the exam, I cannot be employed in a hospital or similar non-retail setting, as an alternative.TL;DR:  Was a teacher, too stressful due to unrelenting violence and micromanagement.  Was computer tech support, but not interested in the field or tech savy enough.  Was Pharm Tech but excessive controlled substance rx patients were too angry and irrational to work with everyday.  Would like a calm job, minimal to no confrontation with the public and no supervisory tasks.  Would like to get my tasks, do them well, have a little bit of freedom without hovering supervisor(s),  have moderate levels of interaction with others, then go home at night.  Wash, rinse, and repeat career.  Don't need a lot of mental stimulation to be happy, just want something peaceful for once.
bszufj	1558819619	717	Hi! I've finally narrowed down my career options after many years of self-reflection, career research and shadowing. I'm stuck now between making that leap into a direction and just going for it, and would love some insight from others.These are the two options (To put things into perspective, I have a science degree with a good gpa, tuition fees are not a concern. I've also researched and shadowed people in the fields listed below so I don't need to do that):Option 1) Counselling + Physiotherapy. I know this sounds a bit crazy to pursue two Masters but a masters in physio in Canada is incredibly competitive. If I first do a Counselling masters, and get really good marks, it will boost my GPA big time and give me a shot at PT school in Canada. I have all my Counselling and PT pre-reqs, plus volunteer experience, so really now its a matter of getting into counselling followed by getting into PT school. I envision a life where I work 2 days a week counselling in a private practice (I'm thinking a shared workspace to cut down rental expenses) and then 2-3 days a week as a physio in a sports clinic. A have a passion for both mental and physical health and I actually think this combination is unique, once I can get through the schooling. I've also always craved having expertise, and using the expertise to educate others on their health. This path would give me that expertise in two areas that are high in demand.My concerns with this are: as a private counsellor, and to some extent, as a physio, I am working for myself which means I have to manage my own taxes, paperwork, admin, and there's no retirement savings unless I am diligent on my own. I currently work for myself (contract position in marketing) and I HATE managing my own taxes but it could be that I'm just not organized. I'm also a bit worried about the burnout rates for both these professions. In addition, I will be in school for another 5-6 years which is fine, but I'll be 37 by the time I'm done.&amp;#x200B;Option 2) Do a Masters in Health Administration and work as a Human Resources manager for our local healthcare system. I could probably get into this masters within 1-2 years, and its a 2 year program so I'd be done by age 34. I would then work my way up in HR management over the next 10 years to a good, stable position that pays 80-100 K. I wouldn't have to worry about my taxes, being self-employed or managing my retirement fund. Things seem like they would be a bit easier. I did a career test a few years ago (a good one) and HR jobs were listed at the very very top for me (so was counselling though) but it makes me think that HR would be a good fit for me.My concerns: HR work will allow me to work with people, but its also largely administrative and process oriented. I don't mind this but I worry I will get bored - but maybe the social interaction is enough to keep me engaged? I also worry about the meaning behind it all - will I regret not pursing counselling and physiotherapy? Any HR managers can give some insight?&amp;#x200B;I realize these options are so different and many people would say for me to pick between counselling and physiotherapy instead of doing both. But I don't want to be a full-time counsellor or a full-time physiotherapist - I really can see myself doing both part-time. &amp;#x200B;Any thoughts? Thank you in advance!&amp;#x200B;TL;DR: Stuck between pursuing Human resources in healthcare which would be less schooling; more stability; wouldn't have to worry about doing my own taxes (which I hate!); Or pursing a masters in counselling ---&gt; then a masters in physiotherapy (I need the first masters to boost my gpa to get into PT school and I find counselling really interesting). This route would be may more schooling, and I'd likely end up working for myself in both fields and would have to manage my own taxes/business/etc which sucks. However, I worry that the HR route will lack meaning and that I will be 50 one day and regret my choice.
bon5g0	1557861095	97	I was working a good job and burned out from it. This has left me with a lot of anxiety in regards to working for someone else and also just being in an office. I'm trying to claw myself out and go back to work, but unsure if I want to do the same job.I am working on search, updating my resume, and preparing for interviews, but it's a real grind. Has anyone been here before and can offer tips on how to find a next move you were willing to do and get back in the game?
bnbb9h	1557576043	504	I am 18, applied to &amp; offered the top 2 business schools in my country. I am an idealist, so it would be great if someone here could tell me whether I am suited for this. (fyi I don't have a specific role in mind yet 😓) What I like about consulting that I've read about:● frequent travel - not because of #wanderlust, but I don't enjoy staying in my stiffling country at all, so missing my home is not really bad for me- would also like to have tons of distance away from my financially-supportive, but extremely unhappy, toxic family. This is a HUGE reason for me - since I was 12, all I've wanted to do was solo-travel away from everyone else, focusing on my work, earning my own money, spending it on things I like, away from my family. I just want my own solitude, independence + work focus- I don't intend to have kids, maybe a cute bf hehe- this is weird but I also really, REALLY love airports. They're my favourite place in the world, aside from parks at night● flexible and adaptive problem-solving- I grew up in an education system where pure rote-learning was rewarded, and a doctor/lawyer is everyone's passion (yea I'm Asian)- I'm okay with repetitive processes, only if they have a good proportion of different stuff to work on. It keeps me engaged and driven● good salary, that increases w your experience + expertise- I like being in a job where I'm rewarded more for having specific skillsets / knowledge, as it really drives me competitively in good ways- I actually love, love graphic designing / drawing etc, so I would love a job which allows me to have side ca$h for expensive supplies. (Honestly this is my real passion... I don't think I need to say why I'm not going after this though) - I like having side ca$h to treat myself to stuff everyone else had but I didn't, such as nice dresses- I have a very strong vision of an ideal house I want to build in the future, idealistic as it may sound, and it requires $$$● job requires you to talk to people (no matter how complicated)- i feel 100x better in an environment talking to people than without- one of my few strengths include great public speaking (told to me by people around me) and storytelling, this might not necessarily translate to helping in consulting thoughBad things I've read so far:○ No time for hobbies / exercise at all (this one is a big hit, reason why I'll choose Consulting &gt; IB is due to better "balance")○ Clients make you want to scream and drink 10 cups of coffee (Based on many memes I've seen here)○ Non-existent relationships with anyone (I don't mind this except for a handful)○ No time for building a family (not planning to)○ You will burnout after 2 years and want to quit? I haven't thought about what job I would want after that though○ Regrets(???)
blx12e	1557267218	524	As the title says, I just finished my first year of my MSW degree. I hated my field placement and I didn’t think I learned much in my classes. I was placed at a community mental health center in a major city where our clientele was mostly homeless or in severe poverty and dealing with severe and chronic mental illness. I worked as a case manager. I hated it because I felt like my work was futile. I met with clients once and never saw them again. It was boring. I was sexually harassed many times with zero support from supervisors. The starting pay for that job is $24,000. Granted, the first year of the MSW program is foundational and the second year is where you start to specialize in your topic (mine is mental health), but as I look over my options for field placement, I don’t find anything appealing. I got into social work to be a therapist but as I reflect, I’m not sure if I want to do that anymore. I’m not sure if I want my *entire* job to revolve around people’s emotional needs, which uhhhh is kind of the point of therapy. But at the same time I’m not interested in being a case manager, a job that helps people find housing, food stamps, etc. Before I applied to social work school, I considered going into the medical field either as an NP or PA. I was set on the PA route because my ex who was an MD said NP’s don’t know anything (my dad who is a much more experienced MD says otherwise). The problem is PA school requires way more requirements as far as courses and medical experience and is much more competitive. So I decided to go for social work. I just found out about direct entry MSN programs where you can earn your Advanced Practice Registered Nurse license in 3 semesters. Also there are only 5 prerequisites, of which I already took 2. Nurses (especially NP’s/APRN’s) make MUCH more than social workers throughout their entire career. A social worker in the end of their career is unlikely to make even as much as a newly graduated NP does. Burnout is high in both fields and I do have a genuine interest in the medical field/physical health as well as a job in which you form a connection with your patients/clients. What I’m thinking right now is that I’d like nursing more because although there is *undeniably* an aspect that involves the emotions of your patients, there are also technical skills involved. I also think that nurses can make more tangible, visible changes to people’s lives. My question is: if I do decide to go the APRN route, do I wait until August 2020 when I graduate with my MSW to apply? Or should I forget the MSW (it’ll cost me another $45k in loans as well as another 700+ hours in a field placement I’m not interested in) and just focus on finishing my prerequisites this summer and working (I currently work as a research assistant) until I can apply for my nursing program?
bh7jc9	1556192054	337	&amp;#x200B;Hello everyone,I need advice deciding on a career path in the health field and want to know any first hand experience or opinions of the jobs.I’m about to transfer to health and medical science with a neuroscience major (previously a psych student and wanted to be a psychologist) and I’m unsure what career path I want to go down. I LOVE medicine and health care the medical field and hospital documentaries just make me go YES inside my soul but I really love the brain neuroscience is so amazing.I either want to do a research or clinical area in neuroscience. I’m concerned that I may get bored with the mundane parts of the job but I have no experience what it’s like working in clinical research or a lab etc.In medicine I would like to be a neurologist, ER doctor or Psychiatrist. I’m hesitant because of medical school and being a doctor is very very big commitment and I’m unsure if I’ll get into med school however I feel like I would really enjoy the job itself. I find medicine interesting but am unsure if I want a hands on role or a research and community engagement roleIn Nursing I would like to do ER or Neurology. I’m not 100% sure what to expect in being a nurse, from my understanding they do more caring and giving drugs and monitoring and less treating and fixing wounds and removing toys from kids ears, putting in Canulas etc. I’m just worried I wouldn’t be doing enough “medical” stuff as a nurse and more caring and paperwork and bathing etc.I would also like to be a paramedic but I’m aware of the high burnout rate and I worry about a lack of job options after I get too old or have to change jobs for any reason.If anyone has any opinions or works as one of the above professionals I would love to hear your thoughts and a run down of what to expect on a daily basis on the job.Thanks
bfwnjc	1555898954	295	Hi! Im a new grad registered nurse. I work part time on a medical surgical floor. Unfortunately where I live, jobs are hard to come by outside of med/surg for new grads. So I snagged a part time job on night shift. I have been looking for per diem gigs for quite some time, and not a single place has called me back. I do 2 12's a week at my current job, so working an extra 1 or 2 days a week elsewhere would suffice. Since I cant find a second gig in nursing, I warmed up to the idea of finding a part time job elsewhere.I have no idea what else to do. Healthcare has been my entire career life from age 16 to now. I am very introverted and I want a solitary job where I focus on my tasks and don't have to interact with people. It would be a fantastic getaway from the social, physical and mental burnout from nursing. The more I think about it, the more I am actually liking the idea. Im open to anything, as long as its something quiet.I would be into anything healthcare, tech or science related, but thats hard to come by without specialized education. I love working with my hands- gardening, cooking/baking, fixing things, outdoor cleanups. I also love to analyze, ponder, use critical thinking. Pretty much things that drew me towards healthcare. But anything goes at this point. Hell, if I could get paid to do sit around and have time to read books 1 or 2 days a week, I would jump on that shit.I just don't know what to look for because most jobs are customer service related. Plus I need something part time, so this adds an extra barrier.
besxsx	1555633762	284	So I[23F] have been working at my current job for about nine months after graduating from undergrad. I was recently promoted, the pay is good, and there are lots of opportunities for upward mobility. However, the amount of work I am assigned is unsustainable. The company assigns projects based on time estimates of how long it should take. However, it is well known these estimates are pretty much bs but the company doesn’t want to increase them since they’ll lose money/won’t be able to accept as much work.I am not shy of hard work or long hours but it has gotten to a point where it is entirely unsustainable. I am not the only one who feels this way, the company has incredibly high attrition from burnout and a toxic work culture and atrocious Glassdoor reviews (which I stupidly brushed off as people being dramatic before joining the company). I have tried raising the issues I’m having and my immediate superiors have been understanding, but upper management just rolls their eyes and tells us they don’t have the capacity to reassign work. When I have managed to get help I’m just assigned an even larger project with an even sooner deadline the next day. This job has lead to me having daily panic attacks, sleep deprivation, loss of appetite, nausea, and lightheadedness. I’ve mostly come to terms with the fact that it is time to leave but I’m nervous leaving after such a short time especially if I don’t have another job in place. Any advice on whether it’s time to call it quits and/or how to deal with stress and burnout if I decide to stick it out until I find a new job?
bdsles	1555412628	266	I am a young male physical therapist based in Australia. I have recently graduated and have been working at a Physical Therapy clinic for the last few months. Over this period, a close high school friend had asked my assistance with his new PT business which is based ~20km away from my full-time role. I agreed and have been taking patients once a week for my friend on my day off from the clinic.~ 2 months on, my employer discovers that I have been working 'behind his back' for another 'employer'.This was primarily due to him wanting me to come in on late notice on my day off, and I told him why I couldn't work that day. At this stage now, I still have not begun my full-time contract which was promised around 2 months ago. My employer acknowledged my need to support myself but stated that once I begin full-time hours, I would need to make a decision on one or the other. He mentioned reasons for this including commitment and loyalty, avoiding burnout and not wanting me to use the skills he teaches me for a 'competitor', despite the physical distance between them. Is his ultimatum reasonable? Any allied health professionals on here able to give me some advice?I am considering leaving the full-time role because I am unhappy with the continuous delays in commencing my contract as well as the general lack of support. My friend alternatively, has been chatting with me about patients for ~ 30 minutes each week, including ones I'm having trouble with for my full-time employer (de-identified of course).
bchlqj	1555096633	498	Hi everyone, first time posting here so please be gentle. I’ve come to a point in my life where I’m in need of some change and after years of trying to figure out “what to do when I grow up” I’ve finally come up with a plan. At 27 I’ve decided to go back to school to pursue a bachelor in Accounting. To give some background, I moved to this awesome country right after turning 21 and I come from a third world country. I was lucky enough to get a very good starting job (around 40k year) but not knowing anything about how being a grown up worked I put myself in some debt and didn’t make many conscious financial choices. Tried college for Business Admin. but found it to be a total bore so ended up dropping out after first semester (all the wrong reasons, I was lazy and had no drive) but I spoke to them recently and they said I can pick up where I left, “just come in and re-apply”. I currently have a pretty good job (low 100’s) that will allow me to support myself and pay my full ride through school. (Associate would be around 3k per semester with a pathway into an accredited university and finish my bachelor for around 9k per semester). Problem with my current job is that it has an expiration date (won’t be able to do it after a certain age) and it comes with some serious burnout. I’m hoping my 30th birthday will be the last I celebrate there. My goal is to: maybe become a CPA upon graduating and/or if my brain is not failing me and I discover I can take it I might look into becoming a tax attorney( this is the real dream but I know it would take many years so I might not pursue) I’m also open to explore similar career options like wealth management and financial advisor. My fear? I’m 27! I’m scared it might be too late for me to have such an ambitious dream. They say you can do whatever you set your mind to but realistically age can play a big role in career making or breaking. Anyone been in my position and succeeded? What advice do you have for me? Should I go for something less complicated and if so what? What are my real chances of being successful in any of these fields? Anything would be appreciated. Worth mentioning I’m also single with no dependents. All the responsibility falls on me and no partner or parent (or family in the US) for support if things get tough. Not saying it’s an obstacle but it does make things a bit scarier. Also my current job has nothing to do with my aspirations which is another reason why I wanna retire in a few years. TL;DR Want to start a career in accounting but I’m scared because I’m 27 and might be too old for it.
bbnrtz	1554912324	125	Hi everyone, I'm looking for some guidance. I'm in my mid-30s and have been struggling with severe depression for several years. For context, I had to leave my graduate program about ten years ago due to burnout and have not had full-time work since then. My resume is mostly volunteer work and the odd part-time position, so searching for a job has been a challenge as a practical matter.I'm looking for generic advice on how best to cope with an already stressful process that's become extremely difficult to bear. Not so much the pragmatic details of how to interview or write a cover letter, but more of how not to collapse into an ugly crying heap while confronting the shame of past failures and the like.
bb3l2y	1554783803	324	Hi hello.I'm a 21 year old college student with a year left at my local community college in the bay area, and I'm really passionate about cooking and hope one day to be a chef, or at least run one of my own restaurants. Something more towards a fine dining cuisine. I have interned, and worked at a couple of upscale restaurants as a line cook, as well as hosted a catering event for a cancer retreat. So far I've been pursuing my associates in business at my comm college, and also have been studying Japanese on the side both in highschool and in college as my grandmother is Japanese but never taught us as kids. I know going to culinary school would be an option, but after hearing the cost of going to culinary school, I've decided to at least pursue a bachelors degree just in case what I want to do in the future, I end up falling out of. (Which I don't feel as likely happening, but hey, burnout and becoming uninterested in the things you are once passionate in can happen). Because of this thought process, I've felt that pursuing a business degree will help me in the culinary world, more specifically, pursuing a business admin/management degree.So far I've been looking into majoring with a business admin/management degree and possible minoring, or double majoring in Japanese. As I look at different 4 years to apply to, I'm starting to have some shaky feelings about where I'm going.I guess I have a bit of a list of questions to ask:1. Is pursuing a business admin/management the right type of degree to be pursuing for a job in the culinary world?2. Should i switch to a different business degree instead of admin/management or will this be enough help for future jobs, not only in the culinary world?3. What would be some colleges that would be a right fit for this type of thing.
b9ueq5	1554486943	215	Does the below sound like an extremely challenging position? Am I worrying too much?   I am looking for a job. I am a bit new to the professional workforce and am asking for advice on evaluating a startup. Not 100% sure what I want to do for a living.I saw an opening for a startup that sounds/sounded promising. The salary and benefits looked OK. It's a remote position though. I don't have all of the experience needed but may could pull it off.Doing additional research on the culture, I found a decent amount of GD reviews. A lot were positive, but most were written by current employees (with 'no cons'). Some said work/life balance is very difficult and some people are working 2x the amount of hours they expected, felt burned out, communication was lacking or changing, the pace was very fast and some said they felt used. Some customer reviews in Google said it was a good product.I could use the experience, the salary looks decent as well as the benefits. I do just have an uneasy feeling after the research? What are some red flags if I get an interview?I don't think I am better than this, but I don't want to set myself up to fail and/or burnout really fastThank you!!!!!
b8rakn	1554251939	171	I’m a preschool teacher in my mid thirties and have my AA. Over the last 8 years I’ve gone from teachers aide to teacher, and my director is eyeing me for lead teacher when that position opens (next 1-2 years). Prior to that I was a instructional assistant working with teens and adults in special education. I love my job but am getting burnt out, hard. I would go crazy doing desk work, would love to work outside, love working with animals, and don’t want to go back for any serious schooling. I have a hobby business doing photography for family and friends, but I am very amateur and don’t really know how my camera works, just have a good eye for composure. I have an interest in interior design, am crafty, and enjoy working with my hands on either small or large scale.I definitely don’t want to go into nanny work. How else can my existing skills translate to other fields?Any constructive feedback would be very welcome. Thank you in advance!

b8e2k4	1554177107	347	Just some background. I graduated May 2018 with a BA in History. When I first got into college I was going to be a history teacher, but then switched to film/video. After deciding that wasn't for me I found occupational therapy. I was excited for it and could apply with any bachelor's degree. Since I was close to finishing my history degree I finished that one. I have applied to occupational therapy programs twice now. The first I was denied and this second time I am the wait list. Classes start late May and I have yet to be selected. I'm feeling a little discouraged. I don't think I am going to apply a third time. I also have the issue of never really being 100% sure on a career. I want to make enough money to be comfortable. I like helping people but more one-on-one or behind the scenes. Perhaps something that isn't to stressful or demanding since I want to give most of my energy and emotional capacity to my family. Below are some careers I have thought about and some of the major problems I see with them. Just looking for any feedback and advice, thanks!School social worker- High burnout rates, depending on what field of social work and area not very good pay. Seems to be stressful. I liked that I could help people and find them resources though.Medical Technologist-Get to help people in a more behind the scenes way. Worried that a lot of people tend to start in 2nd or 3rd shift which isn't to much of a problem right now. Would have to go back for about 2.5 years for the program and prerequisites for a bachelor's. Pay is decent-ish.Certified Financial Planner- This one I haven't researched much but it helps people on a more practical way I guess. I'm just not sure if I would truly enjoy the work. I was a bank teller for about 5 years and left because I was getting tired of it. While not exactly the same I'm worried I would have a similar experience?
b80l29	1554115259	499	Hi all! I'm currently facing the issue of my resume looking less than optimal, so I wanted to ask how much of a red flag it is for recruiters, and how should I approach handling it. To give some context, I'm from Sweden, and most employments here have a "trial" period of 6 months, during which they can let you go on a whim if they don't think you're right for the job, but after those 6 motnhs have passed, it's really hard to let go an employee. I work within IT and am 30 years old. Currently, my resume looks like the following: **2013 - 2014, 9 months:** First part time job, was let go when deemed not efficient enough and company was restructuring. **2014 - 2014, 6 months:** Did not make it past "trial" period, as they thought I didn't fit the company. I have to kinda agree.**2015 - 2016, 17 months:** Quit the job because the company was restructuring, firing lots of people and morale dropped. I felt it was time to move on.**2016 - 2016, 7 months:** New job. Was facing choice of either continuing my current job, or quiting to focus full time on a personal project I've been developing on the side. I decided to quit and focus on the project, big mistake but oh well. After lots of effort, released the project in 2017, which failed completely, so I went back to looking for a job after taking few months off due to a burnout.**2018 - 2018, 6 months:**  Took on a new job as programmer, but wanted to change fields into web design as I've been doing it part time and on the side. Quit the job at the end of the trial period as I got an offer that allowed me to make the wanted career change into design.**2018 - 2019, 9 months, current:** Working as a web designer consultant. My current company been struggling to find me a new client for past few months since I've finished the last assignment, and it is starting to affect my confidence and morale. I am thinking of looking for a new job, so here I am.Having tried couple of places, I've always been met with the question of my resume looking the way it is (even if they contacted me first), the longest job I held was a year and a half, and most jobs being around half a year, which raises eyebrows in Sweden as it seems I never made it past "trial" period despite most being me quitting on my own due to good reasons. So my question is whether I am overthinking it, and a patchwork resume is kinda okay in IT for younger people, or am I screwed if I jump ships again, instead of betting on my current company finding me something new soon? I'm 30 already, feels like most people already done jumping around and are working on their careers, while I still haven't settled. 
azjozs	1552248074	303	I will start out with saying I'm not wanting to leave the construction world but am looking at changing from Fire Protection to Industrial Maintenance. Been at my current company (engineering and project management) for almost 4 years and in the same engineering field for 7 years. I am 30 years old and have only worked for 2 companies since college graduation. Up to the past year I loved my job, but in the last 6 months, some people have retired and our "owners" now want to see more out of everyone. I am starting to feel like a machine, I cant seem to get away from it when I leave work and usually find myself working 12 hour days plus some on the weekends. Current benefits are great $55k/year, 10% match on 401k, insurance is cheap. I believe that I do a good job but they keep pushing everyone to do more, I am prideful in quality work but management wants fast turn around and if there is a problem it will get fixed later. I'm starting to feel like I am reaching a burnout point. &amp;#x200B;Interviewed for fun with a new company (estimating and project management) just to see what was out there. To my surprise they made a considerable offer $68k and $400/mo vehicle allowance, Insurance is about the same cost and I haven't gotten an answer on the 401k. This is a similar industry but offers more variety on my daily tasks. One thing I really like is its a small company who's owner stresses the importance of a work life balance. I'm scared to leave the security blanket I know but I also know that if I stay things likely wont improve. &amp;#x200B;Does anyone have any advice on making this decision that I might not have thought about? 
axc870	1551732855	173	So went I to graduate school with a psychology emphasis. Left over depression and burnout from undergrad followed me to graduate school. i technically finished a year and dropped the last semester classes. I was also academically dismissed. Started seeing a psychologist to deal with the depression.  I worked a part time job and was able to obtain a full time position there. So i have work experience but its not related to anything i went to school for (psychology,BS). Its going on 3 years of being out of school. I know i don't want to continue in the career path i am in now (retail management). I have had some experience with marketing and that part of my job excites me. I also have the desire to go back to school for psychology and focus on counseling. I think i want to try taking classes but i'm not sure what for. My other option is to find a new job. Any advice from anybody in a similar situation would be appreciated. 
ax4s6r	1551687612	799	Hi, this is a long post so thanks if you read it all and respond!Im 27 m and work in pharmacy. Last year after burnout and mental illness, I moved to another country and spent seven months working and living in customer service and teaching English. I had a great time, and I didn't want to come back-finances and losing my apartment meant I had to, which I guess was a blessing in disguise, because I had to tackle some bills and obligations back home.In October, I came back, renewed my licence and took a part time job where I wasn't happy. I just didn't take to the owner of the business, he was a nice man but ever present, and I didn't really feel comfortable. I left to do locum work, which is kind of like free-lancing, but the work was sporadic and the travel was a lot.  At this point (last November) I decided that I just didn't want to work in pharmacy. I don't like it: its too high pressure, I don't have the mentality to hit corporate's bullshit targets or to deal with idiot customers, plus with depression and anxiety, this job just exacerbates my problem.I decided that I want to change my career to software development/web design and to relocate back to Spain (where I spent much of last year) and get my life back on track. I'm tired of being a depressed, lonely, loser and I need to make changes before it's too late and i'm too old to do so. So to further this, i'm saving up to relocate and go to a coding bootcamp over there. That's my dream and it's possible; all i'm doing this year is to reach. that. goal.So, in January, I took a full time position for a chain of pharmacies, I applied for a floating role in my city, but they changed it to a store based role in a town 90 minutes away from me after the interview. Stupid me took it. The store is understaffed, there is so much work I genuinely cannot believe it. I don't get on with my co-workers, and i'm so stressed out and anxious I really cannot function. This is after ONE month! I keep on making mistakes, which on reflection is obviously my fault but also due to the ridiculous demands i'm under. This weekend, I've been having a 3 day long panic attack, minimal sleep, won't go out or turn my phone in due to fear of calls from work, it's nuts.Now my ray of light in all this, is that 2 weeks after joining this hell hole, I decided to go to an interview for a totally different pharmacy role in a nursing home (no scripts to fill, no customers, less money, less stress). They basically gave me the job in the interview, although (due to security) it could take up to 3 months, and that I should expect communication from them shortly.My problem is I need another job now. Just thinking about going into work tomorrow is making my head spin and my guts churn, last Thursday I was almost ran over and wished the guy didn't slow down. Mentally speaking, i'm all over the place. I'm living with my mother at the minute who is also a pharmacist, she says that i'm bouncing around too much and that I need to be stable, endure this for a while and all will be OK. She said that she's worried that eventually I'll turn out to be the kind of person that doesn't want to work, and that everyone suffers and that I have to just deal with the pressure that i'm under.Personally, I understand where she's coming from, because i'm earning good money here; it allows me to save up and yeah its the easy thing to do. But: 1. This job is really affecting my mental health, and 2. I'm only waiting for this other job to come through so I can bounce anyway.So how do I proceed? Do I stick it out until maybe april/may where I am? Do I go back with my tail between my legs to my old boss and ask him for my old job back? Do I ask my prospective job to hurry the fuck up so I can start working there ASAP? Should I just take a call centre job and just accept a decrease in my earnings for this year until I can go back and retrain?Let me know what you think, i'm sorry if that was a rambling mess, my head is all over the place at the minute.TLDR: My job is causing me unbearable stress and anxiety, I need another job ASAP, but also need money and to stay employed, what should I do?&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;
auzoxk	1551189232	415	Got a B.S. in psychology, got a half-decent job right out of undergrad at a rehab facility and have now been there for 2 years. I’m in my second semester of getting an MSW and... I really don’t like it. Everyone with advanced degrees in this field works 2-3 jobs to make okay money, the hours and demand are absolutely insane, there just aren’t enough people in this field to meet the demands of clients. I knew all of this going into it, but at the time I was passionate about it. Now, burnout has me wanting to change careers. My MSW program annoys me and I no longer look forward to going to work everyday. The bureaucracy in social work and mental healthcare at the expense of clients and their families, as well as the workers, makes me sick to my stomach and I no longer wish to be a part of it. I’ve literally seen people die or almost die because of how terrible this system is, I can’t support it anymore.I’m not sure what job paths I can pursue, I don’t really know what I like or what I’m qualified for. I’m a people person, I enjoy networking, I’m very organized and well-spoken. I do well in a fast-paced environment and pick up new roles and skills relatively quickly. Slow jobs that leave me idle for periods of time bore me and I end up never being able to get my “head in the game”. I hate being micro-managed once I know my role, a job with relative freedom in that respect would be ideal for me. I want a field I can grow and advance in, if I so choose. Marketing or something in tech was suggested to me, but I know nothing about those fields or how to get involved with them. I also have to consider that I have to make at least what I’m making now in an entry-level position, which isn’t that much but I have to afford my bills.I’m feeling kind of lost here. I’m glad I figured this out now rather than 20 years from now with debt from a degree I don’t want... but I have no idea how to go about this. Any tips on what fields might interest me, what qualifications they require, and what to look for in terms of jobs would be very helpful. Any and all reading on specific fields, changing careers, and the like are welcome and greatly appreciated!
asey80	1550607944	354	Hello all,&amp;#x200B;Quick background on myself. I started in hotels as a valet during college and did that for about three years. During my last semester, the third party valet company did not renew the contract with the hotel property so I applied for Front Desk. I did that for about a year and a half before moving into accounting in the same hotel as I felt I had nothing left to learn at the Front Desk. In accounting I built experience in group billing while still dealing with customers. After another year and a half, my general manager recommended me to move back into Front Office as the Front Office Manager. It's been 10 months and I've decided that I'm burnt out from the hospitality industry and I've let my general manager know as he's noticed my declining performance. We've decided that it's best for the company and best for my health if I choose to resign. I've given them a 30-day notice and now I am actively looking for a change in career fields.&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;What drove me to burnout was the constant dealing with irate customers, managing team members who lacked discipline, and constantly being in positions where I was short staffed. Above all, being an exempt salary operations manager meant I never really knew my schedule because I was on the clock, all the time. &amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;I majored in Psychology and my dream job is to go into research but at a bachelor's level education, positions are slim to none. I've considered graduate school but I'm not in the best financial situation for that. I've considered human relations, case management, and counseling but I am open to suggestions. I love working with people but I want to work with people who wish to better themselves or their community rather than create revenue for their company. As a business hotel, I spent a lot of time serving those who cared more about their salary at the end of the day rather than the work they do. I'm continually applying for positions every day but I'm not entirely set on what I want to move into. 
aqa5tq	1550084891	440	Hey folks. I’m looking for some public health career advice and possible insight on the **Data Science with R: Data Analysis and Visualization** course at the NYC Data Science Academy.About me: I’m a social worker with a master’s degree in social work as well as a public health. I have thus far only worked in direct practice with clients at really understaffed and chaotic nonprofits but am experiencing some serious burnout as well as vicarious trauma from working with a particularly challenging population. My mental health was in shambles until a few weeks ago and it’s slowly getting better. I’m looking to make a change and am toying with the idea of taking a data science course. I think this will allow me to pivot my career in a way that I can still use the skills and knowledge I have already acquired. I am interested in research positions or jobs at the department of health and mental hygiene for example, basically jobs that have more support, benefits, or flexibility to allow me to take better care of myself and will take me away from direct practice with clients for the time being. I took stats and epidemiology courses in my MPH program and though I wouldn’t say I’m a math wiz, I quite enjoyed them. We barely learned SPSS, let alone Stata and R. It kinda sucked and I want to further hone my skills and improve my marketability.So I suppose my two main questions are:1. **Do you think learning R will help me get a more public health oriented job?** This academy also has Data Science with Python but I know nothing about Python and don’t think many public health oriented workplaces use it.2. **Has anyone had personal experiences with the NYC Data Academy?** The course is a little over $2,000 and while I’m lucky enough to have the savings, it’s a significant amount of money for me. Obviously, self teaching on Coursera or Khan Academy would be cheaper but I’m not the greatest online learner and the money miiiight be worth it to have access to a real live human to answer my Q’s, have something to put on my resume, get a more thorough understanding of the topic, etc. Any thoughts?Finally, before anybody gets worried, I promise I am taking good care of myself. I left my old job before I cracked and have been working some odd gigs while I figure out my next step. Doing lot’s of therapy and self care but my brain is screaming out for new challenges. My bank account is shouting a few things too! Thanks in advance for any advice.
ap9d8g	1549838191	265	I'm a semester away from graduating with a liberal arts BA concentrating in social and behavioral science (21 F, plan on moving to/ near Virginia when I graduate). I am super interested in art therapy but definitely not ready to commit to grad school, especially for such a financially 'unstable' career. I am super empathetic and imagine that I would feel best helping disadvantaged people/ doing social work; despite all the things I read about burnout, I know I want to use my own experiences with mental illness, EDs and addiction to help others. I love nature and fine arts too, and I want to find a job that allows me to integrate this too! However, I'm having trouble 'picking' an area, and I'm scared that once I enter into a certain niche I'll be stuck there. Even entry-level jobs that don't require years of previous experience or some kind of certification scare me, and this is where I will have to start (I've only really had jobs in the food industry, plus volunteer experience with kids). I guess I'm just looking for help with deciding how to start out, or a plan to work towards a fulfilling career. I am totally willing to continue my education or get certain certifications (RBT etc.) later on, but I'm already in debt from undergrad and I need to push myself into the workforce somehow. I also plan on raising kids with my partner in the future, so although I don't really need a large salary I would like to be able to help provide for a family!TIA &lt;3&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;
ap1fp4	1549779431	310	Context: I work full time (in an ancillary field) in a good hospital that is part of a large health system. I absolutely love this job and can see myself staying several more years until it's time to make a move up. I was offered this full time position six months ago, fresh out of school/internship. At the same time, I was also offered a PRN (but more like part-time without benefits- two 24 hour regularly set rotations a month) at a hospital that is always rated among the top 10 in the nation. I took it without second thought as it would be a great eye-catcher to have listed on my resume and would show that I could juggle multiple positions at once, even being fresh out school and new to the field. (Also, who would turn down some extra spending money??) However, I don't particularly enjoy the setting of my PRN position and I'm finding myself exhausted on the weeks when I work the extra 24 hour shift. It seems like I'm always either feeling anticipatory dread for my upcoming PRN shift or utter exhaustion following it. I don't want to push myself towards burnout at the very beginning of my career. It also makes it more difficult for me to cover for others at my full time position when members of our small department are sick or taking PTO. This leads me to my question: I took this PRN position six months ago for the hospital's name to serve as a resume booster and to show that I can manage multiple simultaneous responsibilities well, despite being a new grad. The extra money is nice, but not something my monthly budget relies on. How long should I stay in this position to be able to list it on my resume and have it communicate the things that I intended?
aiwlcv	1548222798	177	I have 20+ years experience in IT, mainly as an app developer. I've taken about 6 months off due to burnout, employer playing games, divorce, and other personal issues. I'm now in the position to get back into a job. Financial obligations (child support, alimony, rent, bills, etc.) seem to require me to remain in my field, where I can make six figures a year. The problem is, I'm still burned out and turned off by all of the B.S. that goes along with the job. I am 0% excited about getting back into IT. If I don't, I can't afford my obligations. If I do get back into IT, do I just suck it up and deal with it somehow? I don't even know what else I would get into at this point. I've thought a different employer could make a big difference, but I'm not convinced, due to my lack of passion for this type of work. Where do I go from here? I'm in debt and very uninspired as I sporadically explore IT jobs. 
ai2j6r	1548019534	197	I'm coming up on 3 1/2 years with my job I started out of college. I work in a small company--when I started, it was just my boss and me--and my boss is like family now. However, she's really overbearing; she never stops thinking about work and basically expects that from me, too. We're coming up on our busiest season of the year, which last year had me working 12+ hours a day and on weekends with no overtime compensation. I also currently don't get any benefits from my job. Once I'm off my parents' insurance, she's said she'll contribute to the cost of my health insurance.Basically, I'm finally hitting the point of burnout and don't know how to leave without damaging my relationship with my boss irreparably. We live in a smallish town and she knows everyone, so I'm also afraid if I leave and she's mad, she'll make it hard for me to get a job somewhere else.My current thought is to let her know in the next few months that I'll be leaving our busy season of 2020, giving her over a year's notice. Anybody have any advice? I'll really take anything at this point.
agdtry	1547589235	604	Hi everyone,I am a 23 year old male and kind of struggling right now with my life. I could really go for some advice. I recently returned to Seattle after some complications involving getting my Bachelor's degree. I worked really hard to complete it in four years but it didn't end up going my way and I kind of had a burnout. I have been stressed out for a while and need some time to think for myself. I moved back with my parents and I am somewhat at a loss. I will  most likely be returning next year to complete my Bachelor's degree. However, in the meantime I need to sort out some questions. Advice/help would be greatly appreciated.Career: My bachelor's degree, when it is completed, will be in history. I don't have any internships, however and am kind of at a loss what I want to do. In the Netherlands, where I got my degree, there wasn't of opportunities for internships during my Bachelor's. Although I really like history, I don't want to do my masters in it. The Bachelors felt too stale and mundane and I was constantly sitting down and reading articles. Ideally, I would like to go and do a masters in the U.S. where I could set my own path and own direction and make valuable connections. My interests are wide, but are all related to people. Some of these things include: History, Politics, Social sciences, Technology, Management. I am not a huge fan of business, but I like management because it involves people and leadership. I want to be able to help people. Any advice on this? Place to live: So I was born in the Netherlands, but have also lived in the US for a while. My mom is American and my dad is Dutch. I have lived and moved ten different times in my life, across two different countries, so I have seen a lot. I can deal with a lot of change. However, I am also constantly searching for a place to settle down. I have lived in the Netherlands (Hoorn, Haarlem, and Nijmegen) and in the US (Florida, Texas, and Seattle). I moved back to the Netherlands because I didn't think I was really American. However, after moving back to my country of birth, I quickly realized that I was more American than I thought. None of the places I have lived in before I really loved. Seattle is nice but the weather really gets me down and it can be hard to meet people. Florida and Texas were fun but too hot. I have never been to the Midwest so maybe I should give that a try. I do prefer the East coast to the West coast, though.People: I am a natural extrovert and have a hard time holding back at times. I can be intense for some. However, because I've moved around so many times, I don't have a lot of friends and I have lost contact with many of my friends over the years. I naturally desire to connect with others, so this can be really hard. I often feel lonely because I don't have the opportunity to sit still and be tethered to a certain place. College in Europe was tough too. It was hard to connect with others, though this also has to do with myself and personal problems in regards to my family. What do you think are the best places for people who desire to connect with others and where it's easy to make friends? Thank you everyone. I hope someone can help me out. 
agdp8h	1547588514	604	Hi everyone,I am a 23 year old male and kind of struggling right now with my life. I could really go for some advice. I recently returned to Seattle after some complications involving getting my Bachelor's degree. I worked really hard to complete it in four years but it didn't end up going my way and I kind of had a burnout. I have been stressed out for a while and need some time to think for myself. I moved back with my parents and I am somewhat at a loss. I will  most likely be returning next year to complete my Bachelor's degree. However, in the meantime I need to sort out some questions. Advice/help would be greatly appreciated.Career: My bachelor's degree, when it is completed, will be in history. I don't have any internships, however and am kind of at a loss what I want to do. In the Netherlands, where I got my degree, there wasn't of opportunities for internships during my Bachelor's. Although I really like history, I don't want to do my masters in it. The Bachelors felt too stale and mundane and I was constantly sitting down and reading articles. Ideally, I would like to go and do a masters in the U.S. where I could set my own path and own direction and make valuable connections. My interests are wide, but are all related to people. Some of these things include: History, Politics, Social sciences, Technology, Management. I am not a huge fan of business, but I like management because it involves people and leadership. I want to be able to help people. Any advice on this? Place to live: So I was born in the Netherlands, but have also lived in the US for a while. My mom is American and my dad is Dutch.

aezvzm	1547240630	388	I graduated from college with an electrical engineering degree. I put in an application at exactly one engineering firm, interviewed the day before I graduated, and was hired two days after I graduated. As a result, I’ve never really shopped around for an engineering job. I accepted a position at a small firm thinking I’d be able to grow a bit and see a variety of types of work. I’m wildly successful with my customers who have started sole sourcing their work to me, but my output is limited and I’m hitting burnout. Requesting help has gotten me interns and untrained personnel for support, who stay long enough to learn something before they’re taken from me by someone with more seniority and absolutely zero oversight of my work.   I’m worried if I voice an intent to leave they won’t sign off on hours towards my professional engineering license when my work isn’t being reviewed. I’ve been told that I will be doing exactly one type of work in the future and the variety of work I was told I’d see when I was hired is in the office.... but we only support specialization.I love the independence they’ve given me to grow my contracts, but as I’m starting to run out of red bull and granola bars to keep going into late hours, that independence is feeling more like abandonment. I can’t keep up with my workload and it shows no signs of stopping but all the support resources in this company are flowing elsewhere. I may just have not been a squeaky enough wheel early enough. My primary client may have a job opening. It’s not uncommon for employees to hop between these companies. The local industry has only a few players in it. I have some questions for people with more experience than I have. Do I stay for the independence and accept I’ll just be a lone cowgirl out here? Do I leave? Do I wait for 2 years to pass so my resume looks better? Is it rude to apply with my client? If not, what advice do you have for jumping ship without hurting feelings in a small industry?They say the “grass is always greener”, but I don’t know what the grass looks like in other engineering firms. Is it like this everywhere?
acmpww	1546636302	332	I've been working for more than 20 years in the library/archives field, the last 9 in a position that I've been burned out on for some time. I struggle to do the quality of work I'm capable of; the well is dry. The job tasks I like and still excel at (research/reference) comprise only 10% of the job. I constantly question how I can manage to stay here the six more years until retirement. I have an MLS, but there are precious few full-time librarian-level positions, especially since I'd be competing with so many younger candidates. I've been checking job ads weekly for years, so am conversant with the market.Question: is it too risky, at my age, to try to get on as a part-time public library assistant in hopes of eventually getting on full-time? I'm OK with doing a job that's at a lower level than I've been accustomed to since library school. This library system has no full-time positions because they promote within, and they have, in general, far more part-time than full-time positions, so that's the main risk. My husband will be retiring in about 9 months, so I'd need to have a job with health insurance by then. The longer I wait/older I get when job-hunting, the less hireable I'll be, even though I'm a "young" 61, highly computer literate, and always interested in learning and growing.Main pros:  no longer stuck at job I'm burnt out on (the job duties would be entirely different), enjoy and am good at customer service and am very isolated where I am now, shorter commute, health insurance IF I can get on full-timeMain cons: much lower salary, no guarantee of eventual full-time position and health insurance by the time my husband retires, no longer able to work the flexible hours I currently doP.S. Yes, I've tried various means to combat burnout on the job, with little success. I have a one-of-a-kind position and there's nowhere else to go within my institution. &amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;
abo3m3	1546390642	108	A little context; I graduated with a degree in biology just over 3 years ago and currently work for a healthcare company.  I think I landed a really unique opportunity, because I've been able to climb up the corporate ladder much faster than I expected, but largely because I just get sh\*t done.  The dilemma that I'm facing right now is that, even though I'm making a \*relatively\* cushy salary, the responsibilities and stress associated with my job are really starting to get to me. I'm curious to hear your stories.  Have you ever regretted being a high achiever/ over-performing? How do you deal with burnout?
aapecu	1546120118	28	I’m only 28, but having only worked in agencies I can already say I’m burnt out. Is this normal? How easy is it to jump to client side? 
a9plq1	1545839438	230	I have no more interest in the IT field because apparantley you need to put so many hours into Networking with other people and self study in order to get employment effectively. Not to mention a portfolio is needed for a lot of those fields which is kind of discouraging to me because a portfolio suggests creativity. I don't like creative work. Same for Tech Writing. Apparantley you need to have some expertise in a certain area and a portfolio in order to Tech Write. I'm heavily considering switching my current liberal arts major to an Accounting degree because it fits my personality. Office environment, generally job stable, repetitive tasking, etc.. Despite a lot of people saying not to get into it if you don't love it, I believe I can handle what it has to offer, even tediously. *However*, what kind of keeps me at bay is that I value my life and I don't wish to come home very late constantly from work. This is a career whose companies generally keep people at work till very late hours on a closely normal basis.What I want is a decent, livable salary to start (50k) with the potential to grow higher and a non-burnout schedule 40 - 50 or maybe 55 WITH a conventional approach to work. If it helps any, I live in NYC.Any suggestions or advice for career selection?
a7u2fi	1545278022	181	Hi all - could really use some guidance here. I’m a 29 y/o female and need to leave sales due to burnout but have no idea what to move into. Bit of context - I’m a former teacher who made the move into sales 5 years ago. I currently work for a huge and very well known tech company doing edtech sales (I suspect because of my background), and have done very well there. However I am no longer happy there (to be honest I’m not sure I ever was), have been experiencing tremendous burnout and perpetual exhaustion, to the point where I’ve just been silently crying at my desk most days despite my success. It’s not a sustainable or desirable place to be, and I’ve been looking at other potential career options, but have no idea what would be a good fit. Most salespeople seem to be pigeonholed and just do sales for the rest of their lives - and I have no idea how to break out of this/what I could do as an alternative. Any help would be appreciated.

a6k5nn	1544917470	368	Hi I graduated school in 2017 with a BFA in graphic design. I went to one of the top art college's in the USA and graduated as one of the top students in my class. Yet, it all really means nothing to me at this point. I don't know if this is burnout - or if this simply isn't for me. I worked as a graphic designer, web designer, etc, and it was my primary activity since youth. However, I no longer feel challenged, fulfilled, or intellectually stimulated. I am not sure how much meaning it offers me or if I feel like I am reaching my full potential by studying this. I felt as if I really had to force myself to be "amazing" in this "career" instead of letting it occur naturally. I think there were only a few projects in which I put genuine love, care, and felt satisfied with what I was producing. I guess I am not sure about myself or who I am anymore.I adored my humanities and history classes when I was in college. They were so gratifying, and I felt like it was a chance and place where I could speak my mind and synthesize complex theoretical thoughts. They were fulfilling and gave me a sense of perspective and meaning. I am applying for graduate programs, but feel lost as to what I even want from them, what I will do with it, and how I will service society with it. Anyway - is this a good enough reason to switch careers? Or am I simply looking for more meaning from my career? One thing that bothers me with design, is that I don't feel mentally challenged. I am also wondering, if I simply just need to study a different type of design, like interaction design and work on building my own projects? I do get excited by the future and I do feel like I am an innovated person. I do like to envision how technology will behave and operate. However, I don't feel a sense of "pride" by being called a designer - I know that sounds ridiculous. Honestly, I don't know - I am a bit lost. 
a4w1pp	1544451662	255	Some background:I graduated with a bachelors of general studies from a major university in 2014. Not specializing was a huge error so I went to massage school in 2015. Overall I enjoy massage and helping clients that are in pain. It’s something I grew to love and I’m very talented. I’ve worked with pro sports teams, nice spas, and became the lead therapist of a major franchise.The downside of my career is that employers only want to pay me based on experience rather than skill. Everyone in my field says to create a website and go into business for myself, but one particular pervert encounter made me decide against that. Even when I became lead, my work refused to pay me the same as our old lead since she was more experienced. This has made me resent work. I’ve looked at other jobs and get interviews easy with my background. But it’s essentially a lateral move.Combine that with mounting injuries and professional burnout stemming from putting in all this extra work only to get paid minimally...i can’t help but think my time is limited in this field. I enjoy helping people and I’m not opposed to returning to school. But I really don’t want to do 4 more years of school in my late 30s. The main things I want are a stable pay considering I’ll put in the damned work, and something to where an injury isn’t something that would prevent me from working like it does with massage. What can massage therapy translate to?
a4nw4l	1544384042	205	Hello All,I'm currently a wilderness counselor. I work with youth between the ages of 12 - 17. The youth come from correctional facilities, have substance abuse issues, behavioral issues, etc. I have a consistent group of about 10 - 12 clients at a time and the average client stay is about 10 months.  This is a 5 days (sometimes 6) a week at 24 hours a day job. I sleep, eat, shower in the woods for 5 days straight before I leave property with MAYBE a total of 30 minutes for a break throughout the day. We hike trails,  have group therapy sessions,  etc. I've been doing this for about 7 months and the signs of burnout are real.  I sleep outside in tents, we eat the same thing, do the same activities. Staying vigilant/aware of all of them, dealing with conflicts, rarely getting peace to yourself for 5 days straight is catching up to me. I know I don't want to be a counselor in my future,  this was something different I wanted to try out before grad school. They asked for a 2 year commitment but idk if I can mentally and emotionally do it for that long.Any thoughts/tips?
a4mjqz	1544375505	48	I'm a mid-sized tech manager, and it seems like there's no way to really keep people engaged after a while.  Something always comes up, burnout or otherwise. How can I be a better manager and better engage with people to keep them around and interested in our mission?
9yen87	1542612905	453	I'm 25 with a BA in Psychology (yes, I know) and I'm working as a psychiatric technician. I've been considering switching tracks for awhile for a few reasons (no opportunity for promotion or significant raises, night shift schedule, general staffing/management issues, burnout, etc.). I'd like to switch to something more 'traditional' but I'm scared that my experience is way too narrow and I won't be able to land a job outside of caretaking/psych. I'd like to do something maybe in public health or patient advocacy or something along those lines, though I'm open to anything, really. I like to have some kind of meaning in my work and for me that usually means helping people.My experience is basically two years as a psychiatric technician, a year in group homes, some volunteering with an organization that provides respite camps for autistic children, and (as random jobs), 3 months in retail and 3 months as a hostess, and about 5 months at a warehouse (but I've been told not to list anything less than 6 months on a resume). I was involved in some college groups (Psi chi, crisis textline, etc.) but not as a leader because I was dumb and focused on my gpa (3.8, though it doesn't matter at all). My current job doesn't really offer promotions or positions of leadership, which makes my applying to new positions pretty weak.I'm wondering what to do. If there's anything out there for someone with such narrow experience, if I could possibly move away from patient care into a position where I could challenge myself a bit more and maybe make a decent wage (at least what I'm making now).Right now I make about 40k/year. It's also important that I have good benefits - I have an immune system disorder that renders me a bit more prone to using sick days (though getting off a nightshift schedule may help). I also like to travel so vacation time would be nice. I'm also open to jobs out of country (USA) since I know asking for a job that pays well with sick time and vacation time with a BA in psych is pretty ridiculous here. Also looking for advice for things I could do to make myself more attractive to new employers. Not making the switch immediately, just thinking within the next year.Also, because I know it'll come up a lot, I know IT is a really lucrative career track but I just have no passion for it at all, so advice to go to school for it isn't what I'm looking for, sorry. Respect to all the IT peeps, it just isn't in me Sorry this got a bit long but all genuine advice is appreciated! Thanks!
9tkxx5	1541171471	89	First post, hope this doesn't break the rules. I've only been at my job for 5 months and it feels completely different than when I started out. I dread going to work every day and have been considering asking for reduced hours. Problem is no one else can do my job so my boss could fire me and replace me easily. Has anyone else been through burnout out early into your job? What kind of coping mechanisms did you use? Did you end up enjoying your work again?Thanks in advance!
9pqry4	1540005885	459	Hi, so I've been working in advertising for over a year as a Media Planner. About 1-2 months ago, I felt a massive "dip" in mood when it came to working there. Every task I'm given has started feeling extremely chore-like as opposed to the "yeah of course ill do it because that's what i'm here for I love helping people!" feeling I used to get. No matter how much I sleep the night before, I always feel exhausted coming into work and extremely drained when the work day is over. I'm generally a person who is tired all the time, but I have zero energy to do stuff I enjoy or learn new skills (which is what my goal is) when i get home. I feel like I'm going nowhere in my current role because they've offered little to no training (this is my first job out of college), and I'm given answers with little to no context as if theyre expecting me to already know the answer. Oh, and Im always being left out of the loop when it comes to emails and meetings so I'm never 100% in the know (though i know in advertising I will never fully be in the know). I've spoken to my managers many times about keeping me in the know, reminding them that I am still very much learning, but the same thing always happens. Then I get reprimanded for misconstruing an ask. I even had a manager pull out a list of every question i've asked that "I should've already known the answer to" (mind you, this job is my first exposure to everything and anything in my current field)I feel crappy complaining, because I have read job burnout stories where they've definitely had it worse, working crazy hours/crazy workloads and having disrespectful coworkers making their lives a living hell. Maybe if I was more in the know, or I felt like a valuable part of the team, I wouldn't feel as sunken about it. It doesn't feel great being at a role for about a year, yet feeling incompetent in many areas because of the poor training here or being assigned redundant tasks that don't challenge me or help me learn. But as every day goes by, I've realized I don't want to do this for the rest of my life as I would love a role that allows me to exercise my creative muscles (I'm an artist), yet lets me play around with numbers (this I like about my current role).After all this long winded explaining, I wonder, is this job burnout I'm experiencing? If not, what could it be? Apologies if some of this is incoherent, my brain stops working after a certain time of day haha.

9oerp5	1539624434	135	I’ve been with a great company for 20 years working as a drafter/engineering tech in which I’ve experienced burnout for quite some time. I started having depression symptoms in July and tried to adjust my meds and struggled through for two months but wound up having a breakdown and having to take time off. The depression has gotten worse with wicked insomnia and problems focusing due to rumination. Right now I’m just trying to get help and focusing on healing my mind. I feel with this much skin in the game as far as time at the job I should just stick with it at least till I’m in a better place. I feel trapped anyways cause I am in a specialized field and a transition would be so difficult. I would greatly appreciate any advice.

9nyffq	1539474479	597	Sorry if the title came out weird, I was trying to give a gist of the situation I have.First off, I have 10+ years of experience in a highly specialised, technical job. Simply speaking, I've been looking for a new job that pays better for the workload I have to carry. I looked locally, but realized I needed to work abroad (again) To ve me more options.To back track a bit, I started asking around and got a referal to "Option 1", ia relatively large but niche (for my field) company. The country it is in is notorious for its cost of living and ready acceptance of long work hours. They do pay very well though, and this specific company is better than most in terms of work hours. They got back to me, and said they didn't have openings on my job grade.So, I move on to "Option 2", where I used to work as a contractor. I left them because I wanted project ownership, and that wouldn't be possible as a contractor. I was, however, in a non-compete clause from the original company that hired me, so Option 2 couldn't absorb me either. It is, arguably, the biggest player in my industry. The country this is in costs less to live in, and the culture is a lot more laid back. Interviews goes well, and after a little back and forth got an acceptable offer. The base pay, however, is lower than ideal but is compensated for allowances and stocks (that come with reasonable enough bonds). I emailed HR that I accept; HR starts the ball rolling soon after. I am currently the standard security checks, as the offer will only be valid if I pass those,Before any papers get signed, Option 1 suddenly gets back to me and said management liked my CV a lot and have decided to open a position if I pass their interviews. I do, and the offer, monetarily speaking, is much better than Option 2. Cost of living is factored in when I say this. No stocks, less holidays, but with a move-in allowance to help me in the initial months of stay (again, with a bond). The base salary, which I really value as it is dependable, is quite high.For the sake of simplicity, let's say the profit sharing and other variable bonuses are of the same value.The question is, do I want to back out of Option 2? I will be burning bridges there, I suppose. The workload for Option 1 will most certainly be heavier than Option 2. In my field, 14+ hours is common towards the end of the project, so Option 1, having much smaller projects, will be lot more hectic. Burnout is common. Option 2 has a bigger team, 4x as big, and a lot more seniors on board. Maybe I am over valuing the financial aspect due to my current situation, but I am leaning towards Option 1.Can I even back off? I was betting I could, if I wanted to, as I have not signed anything yet, but is my assumption true? Will I potentially be put on some no-hire list, if I back out? What would be the best way to communicate this to Option 2?Other minor factors include the countries themselves. I have family living in Option 1, which is why I targeted it in the first place. But I have lived in Option 2 for years also, when I worked as a contractor for them.Sorry for the long post, and thanks in advance for any help anyone can offer.
9mhyt9	1539026322	274	Hi all,I  am a 25 yo male, getting married in 2 weeks, and a homeowner. I am sure  this question has been asked time and time again, but I’ll ask anyway. I  have been working in public safety (EMS and firefighting) for the bulk of my adult life. Recently, I have begun to feel burnout at work, and am  starting to reconsider my career path. I initially planned on going  into nursing within the next few years, however, I am starting to wonder  if I want to work in healthcare for the foreseeable future. My  problem is that I really have no clue where to begin looking for a  different path. As stated, my whole adult career has been centered  around this one field, and now I feel very lost. I don’t plan on  outright leaving my job, and am not opposed to going back to school. I  currently have an associates degree (with a focus in firefighting), and  my company will offer me money to return to school. Do  you fine folks have any idea where I can find resources to explore new  job and career paths? Or have any of you had a similar experience?  Honestly, at this point, I am all ears to any suggestions. When I was in  junior high, we had a website called Career Cruising, which helped you  explore fields that may interest you, but I no longer have access to it.  Are there any resources like this for transitioning adults?Once again, I’m sorry if this has already been asked. Thank you guys!
9lk145	1538722822	470	Long story short: the last 18 months have not been good. I had a career type of job but burnout, depression, divorce, etc. and now I have a call center type of job. I need something better but I don't know what kind of work I am capable of being hired to do. I am going to briefly describe my background and previous jobs in the hope that fresh eyes will see new opportunities.I have no degrees or formal training. I have a high school diploma. Otherwise I am self-taught or picked it up on the job.My previous job was for a behavioral health provider. I was deeply involved in the training, support, and development of their electronic health record, or EHR. I had this job for over ten years so these skills were well practiced. I assisted with work flow development and deployment by meeting with staff to understand their needs, then worked out ways to get the system to accomplish those needs. I hid fields or added new fields in the EHR, presented my proposed work flow, took feedback, and made adjustments until the process was ready for use. I also worked as a kind of liaison between users and IT to request new custom forms, adjustments to existing forms, or report needs. I developed training guides and provided training for individuals or groups. I did onboarding training, refresher training, focused/updated process training, and Q &amp; A type training.In between all that, I took regular help desk tickets regarding most aspects of the EHR.I helped my company to implement their first EHR. We were in the final stages of implementation of the second EHR when I was let go.I briefly worked in the detox of the same company before being chosen to be a trainer. I've had a couple brief call center tech support jobs before that, but that was a long time ago. I was also a camp counselor. I enjoyed being a stay at home dad for a few years.I currently work for a contractor for airbnb. In the past six months I've worked up through the work types and now I work on property damage claims and take occasional emergency calls. There is nowhere up for me except for leadership, which wouldn't pay much more.My problem, and part of why I stayed too long at my last job, is that there are very few EHR positions out there. Also, I'm not sure that I want to work in the mental health field anymore.My hope is that my skills are transferable to another semi-skilled position where I can make a bit more money. I'm open to suggestions and possibilities.I am grateful and thankful that you took the time to read through all of this. Any thoughts you may have are welcome and valuable to me. Thank you.
9kkant	1538427552	104	I work ems right now.  Work 2 jobs, and as of now its fine. The ems burnout is inevitable though, at this pace.  I am looking into a local college that offers an online degree in information tech that covers CISCO, and a various amount of other networking and entry level coding things.  This, along with some of the online coding and networking classes offered everywhere for free, would be the base before I tried to get a job.  I would want to further my education as well. As far as entry into this field, would this be a good start?
9kbxbx	1538356681	165	I'm a senior getting a BBA with a concentration in finance. I'm interviewing to be a financial representative intern at an insurance company. I have also been toying with the idea of commercial real estate. I want to figure out what my average income would look like over the course of a 20 year career, and get input on things like burnout etc. I don't have the best grades but I think up to a degree I can apply myself and learn anything. What I want to know is if it would be worth it for me to go through the process of becoming a CFA, how long that would take, how hard is it, etc. I understand being a CFP is not as hard as a CFA. I also understand being a CFA would focus my careers to a more corporate or IB type role as opposed to a CFP being more retail. What are the main differences between these 2 types of careers? 
9hzfe0	1537620485	313	I've worked under a plethora of large grocery store chains such as Safeway and Sprouts in store management. Most of my job duties entailed leading a team of 4-8 people, ordering product, maintaining backroom conditions and in stock conditions, assuring that the department of parts of the store I'm responsible for are in peak condition, scheduling, etc. I've been personally responsible for as high as 75,000 a week in sales. Plus I've grown very experienced in high stress and demanding situations. Grocery management can be extremely demanding and very high stress if you're working in larger stores. There's a lot of information department managers have to take in, which involves multitasking and keeping your head on straight.  I've been lucky enough to perform in some of the show stores or flagship stores for their region. Under this I've obtained a few certifications in retail management and leadership. I used to love what I was doing but over the last year or so I've experienced a huge burnout and frankly, crippling boredom. I really want to branch out and take this experience to different industries and try to find myself in jobs that are more engaging and less demanding physically, as working retail has led to some arising health issues from the repetition and motions I engage in on a daily basis.  I just have no idea where to take this. I don't carry a college degree, just a lot of experience in management. I'm also worried that grocery store experience on this level isn't exactly going to get me very far in other avenues. Any advice or recommendations would be fantastic. I'd hate to see 5 years of building myself up to this level get tossed out of the drain. Although I'm at that point where I'm about ready to pretend this never happened and start from square one doing something else.
9hw7a3	1537582376	250	Hey guys, I hope this is the right sub for this question. I am 23 and just graduated university in May with a degree in Economics. Currently, I just interned at a state agency for the summer and am taking some time off. I thought this time off would help, as I have experienced burnout these past few years (held a part time job since I was 17) and wanted to de-stress a little. Unfortunately, I am not enjoying it all, and find myself wishing to be volunteering, finding jobs, or doing anything to keep myself busy really.The thing is that I have a couple of minor health concerns and I need to go to the doctors constantly for the next couple months. I would like to start my job search and get a decent full time, but I cannot if the pretense is that I will have to miss days for doctors appointments. I have heard from countless sources that I will become less marketable if I stay home or keep my mall job and do not immediately find a full time job, as the financial services industry is very competitive. On the other side, if I do not deal with these dreadful appointments, I may not have a chance to later and regret it. What is the right thing to do here? I worked very hard for my degree, as has everyone else, and do not want to pass up any good chances. I would really appreciate some advice!
9hp1bb	1537531234	469	I have been working as a System/Business Analyst for 3 years with variety of different Telecom projects, and in IT for 5 years in general, all in the same company. What I mostly do is have long, tiring meetings and sessions with stakeholders, gather requirements, and then create technical design documents to pass it forward to developers for implementation. I wouldn't say I am passionate about it, but it matches my skill and mind set pretty well, although I would prefer having less human interaction.After major corporate changes, seeing a lot of friends and colleagues leave, and also a heavy burnout I decided to leave the current company and went looking for other options.After some interviews I have been given two offers. I know some people from both companies since IT job market in my country is quite small, so I have gathered some impressions and reviews for both.&amp;#x200B;Company A:For now it is my primary choice. Position I am going for is Data Analyst. My experience with data extraction and processing is limited, but I completed a test (real-life task example) during an interview, showed good results and enjoyed the process as well. I know for sure that this type of work fits me better. There is no client involved, i.e. you work for the company itself. Deadlines are less strict, less stress overall. However, domain is different - it's work with financial data, which I have no experience with. Salary is higher than the one I have today (40% increase).&amp;#x200B;Company B:Same position/responsibilities I have today as a Business Analyst, but in a very reputable consulting company. Impressive 80% increase in salary. They work with variety of projects, offer in-house products. In my region it's the best opportunity for career growth. Naturally, they offer the best quality product and clients are very demanding, leading to unpaid overtime work. No work-life balance, from what I hear. Kind of similar to my current job situation, but they do pay well...&amp;#x200B;For some context:I have been under a lot of stress for the last year. finishing my Masters' degree, working way more than I should have been, having periods of depression... Basically, being burnt-out for this whole time. Company B is really eager to have me, but I am afraid I won't be able to handle such levels of stress any longer. Some people say Company's A option is a downgrade both in means of work and salary, but since I only have just turned 25, I keep thinking there's no point in rushing it.&amp;#x200B;Would you go with Company B, just because of the pay? Or is it worth turning them down for now? I have a feeling they will keep contacting me even if I decline their offer today.I would appreciate your advice if you have ever experienced a similar choice.Thanks for reading!&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;

9fbbrx	1536783616	381	Hello r/careerguidance,I need your help today... Only very recently have I narrowed down what I want to do with my life; to these two paths. I'm not really sure which one would be best as they both have their own distinct pros and cons. I know only I can make this decision, but I figured getting some thoughtful input would help put things into perspective.I am super passionate about critters of all kinds, and I was completely settled on studying to become a Vet Tech... UNTIL I started reading all the horror stories. Overworked, underpaid (I'd be taking a ~16K/yr pay cut to do this job), demanding/rude doctors, crazy schedules, etc. Plus it's not always sunshine, rainbows, puppies, and kittens in there. There is some shit that you see. Surgery, euthanasia, etc, and you sure as hell can't save them all. I think I'm prepared for that part of it. It is about helping as many animals as possible, and that is worth it to me. But there is the looming threat of burnout that I see so many techs write and speak about. I don't want to make a huge personal and monetary investment into this field only to want to leave it a few years later...My other option is to become a mechanic. Working on old muscle cars has always been my favorite hobby and I've been doing it as an amateur since I was 13 (24 now). My uncle has been a pro for 35 years, so I'm sure with a little tutelage from him I'd be able to get my chops pretty quickly and get into a trade school. Problem here being that I fear this line of work would not be as personally satisfying. There are also some of the same pitfalls as earlier; overworked, crazy schedules, etc. I definitely have some discussing to do with my uncle on it. In this field I would be making significantly more income (but still a drop from what I'm making now). For reference, I am a 24 y/o male making 46K/yr. I have a music degree and I'm stuck in a dead-end customer service job... hating every second of it. If you took the time to read all this, thank you and have the best day of your life!!
9da4dz	1536176437	386	Using a throwaway for privacy reasons.The bullet points:- 9 years of professional experience. BS in CS from top 10.- I’ve been going pretty hard since undergrad, at one point sacrificed a long-term relationship for career related goals (not worth it), and at another point went without taking a single day off for 20 months straight.- 5 years in software engineering at top 5 tech co.- Hopped to medium sized company and pushed into management.- Did 3 years there in management. Did okay, frequently received feedback that I was driving my team too hard and too aggressive. Got raises and a promo.- My Director left and I ran into a lot of conflict with the VP. At this time I also started to really feel the burnout, so I took a package from VP and left.- Immediately felt itchy and jumped back into a small venture-backed startup as CTO. Did that for a year, but didn’t really like it because the business was scatter-brained and incoherent (that one is on me, I should have known given it’s a startup).I’ve been taking a few months off, taking some online courses in topics I’m interested in and have been exercising a lot. However, I’m feeling the itch again and I need to be doing something, despite knowing that my burnout isn’t entirely cured yet (I have no idea how to cure this burnout anyways btw).The way I see it, I have 3 options in front of me:- Go back to a bigger company, try to slow it down and find some balance and just live life. *Concern: I’ve done quite a bit of corporate work so far, and the prospects don’t feel very exciting.- Entrepreneurship. Try to bootstrap something off the ground on my own. *Concern: I’ll readily admit that I’m not a huge ideas guy. I have some, but they always feel half-baked and that bothers me.- Graduate school: MBA or MSCS. *Concern: I’m interested in the learning itself but what’s the practical outcome though, given that it won’t boost my career at this point? I have good savings but I’m not rich, and I’d rather not throw money away.Thanks for reading, Reddit. I’d like to collect as much feedback as possible to surface my blind spots and cover my edge cases, so if you have any, please shoot.
99xq0n	1535119795	585	I am *tired.*  I have health issues. I also have ADHD, but it's honestly never gotten in the way of a job before this one, though it made specific tasks in my last job especially arduous.&amp;#x200B; I rocked my last job, and took a position that was a step up in another department.  The department and I have been surprised and disappointed to watch me struggle, struggle, struggle.  We went through some serious burnout phases with bad management and under-staffing, and I never recovered from that.  Now we have a good manager, but she still pushes us hard - and I literally just want (and take) a nap every day.  I'm doing everything I can for my health.&amp;#x200B;Here are some reasons not to take the old job: * It's a step down, and most people will see that on my resume* 25% is HUGE* I started saving for retirement a decade late in life. I've been catching up, but will have to reduce my contributions significantly if I reduce my salary.  Most of my disposable income goes to retirement presently.* My 300 peers will see the move as strange, a step down, and a failure where I work.* Taking a lower salary in my 30s means less negotiating power as I progress through the rest of my life.* The old job still has some tasks I strongly dislike, although I might be able to negotiate out of the two worst* Less vacation time* Less sick timeHere are some reasons to take it:&amp;#x200B;* I miss excelling at something* I loved talking to people all day, every day* The work never followed me home* I think I'd have time in my life to think again in my off-hours, instead of just surviving* I wouldn't have to worry about performance improvement plans, or being fired* I have some friends there. I actually visit and hug them 1-2x/week* If I leave my top employer, which is excellent, while I'm excelling at this other job, I can probably come back.If I leave my top employer to work abroad for a year, something I've always wanted to do, then I would like the option to return.  I don't believe I would have that in my current position, but I think I'd have it in my old one.&amp;#x200B;My lifestyle is pretty lean.  I spend a few hundred dollars a year on tea, and I buy nice groceries without worrying about the cost too much.  I don't spend more than necessary on clothes &amp; shoes.  I have an extremely modest rent I pay, with roommates.  I do like to take art and yoga classes.  All these are in the $100s of extra dollars per year, not $1,000s.  I do believe the "tightening of the belt" will mostly come from being less generous to my retirement account, and probably not taking a $2k vacation every other year to see family or another nation.  I can survive in my current position.  It just takes everything I have, and then just a pinch more than I think I have in reserve.  I can thrive in my old position, I'm pretty sure.  But my precious retirement!  And that sick time!!  Ah, what to do?  Looking outside my top employer is of course an option, but not one I'm seriously considering at the moment, as I'd like to leave on excellent terms so that I can always come back.
97sgpj	1534427610	1106	Hi everyone,I am currently trying to decide on a career path and I'd love your advice! I'm trying to decide if I should go to become a special education teacher or go into product management. Here are the details or my situation:So I am currently in a bit of a dilemma. I am going into my last year of college as an English major and psych minor and have to decide what I want to do with the rest of my life. Last year I decided that I wanted to go into teaching. Where I live (in MA) you have to go for your masters in teaching and after that program must also take additional classes to maintain your liscence. You also have to pass many exams in order to gain your liscence as a teacher, and because my undergrad degree is not in special education (the area I would love to teach) I would have to do some mentoring. I've already passed two of my five exams but have stopped studying for a bit because it was just too overwhelming with work and I felt like I needed a mental break to figure out my life (haven't even been able to look at the study guides). I think teaching would be amazing and I love the idea of working with kids and helping others, but at the same time I feel like I'll become so burnt out from teaching and not sure I can handle the workload and stress. In my head, here are the pros and cons:Pros- helping children learn and watching them grow and develop, being a support system for them. This is a really big thing for me! In order to feel fufilled at my job, really think I need to do something that helps other. Especially if it's hands on. - I will get to have summers off that I can travel during or spend time with my future kids (although will probably always have to work through these breaks for the money)- working with others who share the same passion as meCons - the crazy workload that teachers have, have heard of many teachers who work 50 to 70 hour work weeks, which to me is insane. (I have a family member who works in special education at the high school level and she says she had lots of work the first few years but nothing that bad and now she mostly works 40 hours a week, heard another English teacher who only works 50) Don't mind working very hard, especially at first, but a work life balance when I have a family with be very important to me. - the pay; although the pay isn't terrible in MA, it isn't the highest paying job in the world (eapecially for a job where you have to have your masters degree) I don't want lots of expensive or fancy things either, just don't want to constantly worry about money and would love to have the ability to travel to other countries and see the world (even if it's on a very tight budget)- not being able to move around too much with my job. Teaching jobs in the New England area are pretty decent from what I know, but I have heard crazy stories about how bad teaching situations/pay is in many other states, which keeps me kind of locked down to this region- not many positions to move to within the teaching world. Feel like once your teaching the only other higher up jobs to move to are becoming a principle or writing curriculum, neither of which I really have an interest in- feeling drained from the job :/ so many people I have heard from quit teaching after a few years. They say they love the kids but always feel physically/mentally drained from the workload and stress of the job. **Also in order to have some of my masters student loans forgiven I would need to stay at a teaching job for 5 years....and I know I'll have to be locked into that position for the time. Since Ive read articles online and been told by people that I should never ever go into teaching  due to many of the reasons on the "cons" list, I decided to see what else there was out there that I could get a job with just my English degree and some senior year internships. This is when I came across Product Management. I am a very creative yet organized person and found that many people said they could find a good work life balance with this job so I thought it was pretty interesting. While I still need to research this job a bit more, and don't really have a pros or cons list for it, here are some of my thoughts:- think it would be a great job because I've heard people say that they can actually work 40 hour weeks (if they find the right company) and not have to take work home. This is such a big deal to me because (although I will work extremely hard) I don't want my whole life just to be me at the office for 60 or 70 hours a week. It also seems to combine a bunch of skills together and I love the idea of having a job that is always exciting and ever changing. Also heard that the pay can be really good as well, which is always nice. - however, I'm a little nervous about how to break into this feild and wonder if it will be fufilling? I've never been the suit and tie girl, and have never pictured myself in a big business job, working to make money for a big industry dosent really interest me, but I heard you could also work at a non-profit, but I'm sure that come with pay cuts and more work as well. Overall I'm a bit confused as you can see, lol. Want to go into teaching but not sure if I can mentally handle taking/studying for all those tests and an additional 2 years of school (part time night classes), possible crazy work hours, the stressful job/possible burnout. At the same time could I be fufilled working at an office job doing project management? Would I wish I had just gone to be a teacher? How hard will it be to find a job?**Sorry for the crazy ramble! At the end of the day I know it's my own personal decision, just looking for some advice either way. Teacher and PM opinions would be amazing!! Thank you so much!!
95amut	1533639710	264	I am in my early 30s and have bachelors degree in Organizational Communication. I have been a freelance writer since graduating in 2014 - basically creating online content. But I am so burnt out on this. I was pursuing a master's in Speech-Language Pathology and I was loving it... then this year my fiance passed away unexpectedly and suddenly in a horrific accident and my world was flipped upside down. He died of a TBI and at the time, I was learning about TBI in my classes.I've had to put the education on hold because it is so demanding and with the grief I am dealing with, I can't focus or put the energy into it that it requires. I am feeling so lost in my life now. I have very little motivation to write much (and before anyone suggests therapy, I just started seeing one for the grief).I'm an ISFJ on the Myers-Briggs and a HSP (highly sensitive person). Other career paths I've considered: kindergarten teacher, therapist (but I'm lukewarm about this one), real estate (my dad and grandpa were realtors).I would like to be able to use my actual degree I already have in a communications type role, but at the present moment, I'm residing outside of the country so I can only take on remote positions. I'm not sure if I should keep pursuing speech pathology when I'm feeling a little better. It is a very competitive field and a lot of SLPs complain about it. I'm very lost at the moment. Any input/advice would be welcome. Thank you for reading :)
955wmd	1533594572	272	I work in a digital agency. I moved from a strictly production role to a role where I manage others in my department as well. This happened as a result of me taking on the responsibilities of my previous manager after they quit. They were looking to hire someone else for that role, I applied and was denied based on experience. A year went by with no replacement, just me taking on the work with no compensation.Finally after a year with no one in the role, they gave me the official title and compensation. I was and am so thrilled for this opportunity to explore new career options and gain new skills.However the pace of work has become unbearable. I consistently work 10 hour days, trying to balance my new responsibilities on top of a certain percentage of "billable" work which never really changed after the new role assignment. My feeling of being overwhelmed is now compounded by stress related health issues I've begun to experience. I feel like if i keep going at this pace, I'm going to put myself in the hospital.But now I'm at this place where... I'm afraid to tell my boss how overwhelmed I feel because I feel like it makes me look like I wasn't prepared for the role, while at the same time feeling like my workload is unrealistic. **What advice do you have for dealing with / preventing burnout?** Some things I've done so far:- set a time for myself to leave the office and don't stay past that- set up lunch meetings with other department leads to get an idea of their stress levels
8zdf06	1531765704	489	I just turned 26, and have been confused as to my career path. I received my B.S. in Psychology and Neuroscience in 2016, and have since been dabbling in a couple of classes each semester since then. I have a 3.6 GPA. I do not want to go into counseling due to the burnout rate and low compensation.I currently work in a call center making 30k a year, with a 10k a year bonus potential, processing renewals/inside sales and doing some account management work. I have been considering going back to school to get a new degree, but I don't have much left in the way of federal loans, and if I went back I would pursue something that would be guaranteed to be lucrative (i.e. engineering).I have also been considering the following: Stay at my current position and see if I can move up. After about a year, I have the chance of being promoted to a specialist position- same duties- but I'd make 35k a year instead of 30. I've been considering data analytics, going further into debt for an accelerated nursing degree, getting a master's in experimental psychology and hoping to get into a PHD clinical psych program, as I hear the pay is pretty good and I could research things I like (don't think I have the credentials for a clinical psych PHD right now, despite having a publication, decent GPA, good references, some presentations, and research experience).   Bioengineering seems neat. UX/UI seems cool, as well. I love psychology, but wish I could blend it with something that is lucrative for a career. Human Factors also seems cool. I have considered abandoning everything and going to trade school for something, or getting an associated in accounting or mechatronics at my local community college. Two of my brothers work in Air Conditioning and do okay (20/hour), but that work doesn't seem appealing to me. I also considered the post-bacc OSU program for comp sci, but don't think that is for me either- despite the good earning potential. I don't want to go further into debt for another bachelor's degree if I can help it. I'm already about 49k deep in loans, and have issues living paycheck to paycheck with my partner. I'm just lost, and I feel like if I don't start a new path in this 26th year, I might never. It is hard to live off of 30k a year. I was just asked to build a knowledge base deck to help onboard new employees at my current job, as well as start leading strategy sessions/think tanks for our sales team- but this wouldn't expedite the pay raise/promotion. I still have to wait about 8 more months until I have been here a year.     Any advice would be appreciated. I can provide any info that might give you some clarity on my past experiences.   Thanks /careerguidance/ !
8w0j7w	1530698892	444	**tl;dr Quit a job I loved for one I thought would lead to a career. New job didn't work out. My old boss did say that I could give him a call, but I need more money than what it was offering. Should I ask for old job for now, ask for something higher up in another store, or look for a new job altogether?********I used to work for a popular "high-end" outlet store, which I totally adored. It was one of the best jobs I've held, but I didn't get many hours. I sought out a second job with the intention of keeping my old one, but then I found an entry-level that would lead to an ideal career in pet grooming. (OJ=Old job)The new job was in such a rush to get me hired and on board that I ended up missing some [important stuff, including tests/finals,] (https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/8svrt9/professor_never_replied_and_now_i_failed_her/) doctor's appointments, summer classes, and OJ's shifts. I desperately wanted to make a Reddit post for advice, but this new job threw my life into such a shitstorm and I had to make a decision before even consulting a therapist. So through many red flags, including more than what was listed here, I was so excited to work for this company that I quit OJ in tears about five hours before my next shift. I knew deep down that it was a bad decision, but I kept telling myself that I need to do what's best for my future.Not even two weeks later, I had given myself terrible burnout and gotten sick. I had a complete mental breakdown when a puppy I was in charge of covered itself in piss and shit and was flinging it EVERYWHERE. I couldn't even talk, I just went home and called in the next day and never went back. I'm now on a mini-vacation while gathering my thoughts and ideas (it's also my birthday this week, I already had a trip budgeted). (This isn't meant to be a sob story, I just needed to rant for a bit lol)My mini-vacation is almost over and I need to get down to business. I was barely scraping by financially with my old job, but this is a big company with many international locations, so maybe I could ask for a job where I'd get more hours at possibly another store? Should I text my boss or stop by the store? *As much as I loved the job, part of me feels like I should be looking for "big girl work" like an office job to help clear out some of my college debts.*Any advice is helpful, thanks for reading this far!
8t4lix	1529699745	669	So, I, like probably 90% of the folks on this sub, am in a bit of a personal career rut. I'll get into my specific circumstances shortly, but I also am interested more in the process of figuring out my next career path than in just getting answers and suggestions directly. Ultimately whatever I do is something I need to figure out for myself, but I really am trying to get my blinders off and figure out how to properly suss it out.Are there aptitude tests you've found valuable (not sure if I wanna shell out $700 for a Johnson O'Connor battery, but not ruling it out)? Are there specific sorts of career counseling firms or placement groups that I should be looking for? Is it worth actually literally asking former employers what they've noticed about my strengths?I'm having difficulty partially because I'm having a deficit of inspiration. I'm not particularly driven to do any particular thing. And I also have a limited, possibly over-critical outlook on my own qualifications and potential. So I don't know very well either what I want to do *or* what I *can* (or could potentially) do.And I guess, in a way most importantly: What questions should I be asking myself to try to frame this in a more manageable way? Obviously, the question "what do you want to do with your life?" Isn't really eliciting strong reactions... so how can I figure out ways to get around to that question?Now for more about me if you wanna throw out specific ideas:I have a BFA from a respectable undergrad program in Theater (trained as an actor). Pursued acting for a bit after graduating in a major city, but slowly fell out of the rhythm of pursuing acting work (never really transitioned into paying work successfully) and ended up making ends meet doing customer service based work at non-profit theaters (after a brief stint doing telemarketing and street canvassing for planned parenthood). I've bounced around at different artistic institutions and now do full-time Box Office work at a respectable theater in this city. I've got a decent amount of familiarity with the non-profit arts world from my work at these various institutions. For a while, I've kept my eyes peeled for opportunities to advance into the administrative side of the work (either via Marketing or Development), but never really managed to definitively follow through. And I'm definitely feeling less eager about ticketing than I did a year ago. I don't know that I'm not facing a similar burnout even if I do transition into a different workflow within non-profit arts, though who knows for sure?I've got an interest in logic and have slowly dabbled a bit in teaching myself programming (python... been going very slow...) I'm fairly comfortable with computers so perhaps the idea of accelerating my training in comp-sci and programming might be intriguing... .I could also have some interest in something like social work, with looking to advance on to being a therapist?Or maybe look into law school?I like writing... I have a decent enough command of the English language that something with a heavy writing focus might be interesting... but what? Marketing? Grant Writing? Journalism? I don't have any other skills for that...I love listening to public radio... maybe my non-profit chops can be leveraged into an NPR job?I could go on... but you get the idea... when everything is an option... nothing is... and I have a ton of anxiety around overcommitting on a track (especially if it requires additional study and... well... student loans) and then not having it pan out... I'm currently debt free but I recognize I may have to incur some debt if I lack the credentials to actually accomplish much professionally...Especially since I have a hard time articulating my qualifications. I mean... customer service. I am decent with computers, sociable, communicate effectively, and I'm a hard worker? How do I pad a resume around that and sell myself as "effective in administrative work?"So... Thoughts?Oh... I'm 30. 
8sekfi	1529460318	262	I have this short term goal of mine. Kind of a dream i've wanted to become reality since i was a kid. it's insanely difficult to achieve for most, but i know for sure i have the talent to do so if i were to commit full time to really iron out some flaws i have within myself.Like i said, i'm 23 years old. I live with my parents working full time as a barback/bartender when needed. Its good money, but the company i work for is kind of killing me inside. Long hours with 1 day off a week. Sometimes ill get 2 days off every 2 weeks.Ive recently had several opportunities to work towards my dream and i really feel like i cant pass them up. This goal of mine doesnt last long for the average professional(2-5 years maybe?) mostly due to burnout.Ive saved up a decent safety net to keep bills paid for a while, but i also drive for lyft and amazon so money wouldnt be an issue...I put my 2 weeks notice in a few days ago and with no counter offer, my boss set my last day for next week. My resume is solid and updated. I really dont even know why im posting this, now that i think about it, im just curious as to what yall think i should do... Im thinking if i put in about 2 or 3 months of hard work, i could make this dream a reality.If you havent guessed already, its working in the esports industry as a pro player
8rbe9c	1529073214	208	## Background -I studied business and received my degree in 2012.After college I got a sales rep job for an oil company and did that for 5 years. Afterwards I moved cities and took another job for about a year with a competitor and then recently got a new sales position. The problem is that I am consistently unhappy in these jobs and can feel the sales burnout coming fast, especially since this new job lied about the amount of travel I will need to accomplish.I have 6 years of sales, account management and project management and marketing experience but I do';t want to hunt and cold call anymore. I don't like doing short term stints, this new job is only 3 months in, and my previous was just over 1 year.I want to get into a marketing or project management and have the experience but not sure what the standard is for moving out of a sales role?The current role I have allows me to set meetings for myself so interviewing wont be an issue but I am worried that since I am only 3 months into a new position scrutiny will arise from interviewers.Just want to see if anyone has a similar story and thank you all!
8mv4np	1527557221	248	I'm currently a 25 year-old caseworker for a nonprofit that works with at-risk youth. I've really enjoyed working directly with the kids and teens and have lots of opportunity for overtime, but the low pay, long hours, high workload, and sedentary nature of the job are pushing me away from it. I've worked for burnout jobs in the past, and it'd be nice to have a bit more balance in my life. I have a BS in Kinesiology, and was thinking of getting a personal trainer certification since that can open up doors to some decent paying side jobs (at least $20/hour). I'd also find it very rewarding. I also recently got an EMT-Basic certification, so that gives me an extra skill set. The downside is that being an EMT is still considered a low-paying burnout job, and I get the impression that private companies couldn't care less about their employees. It would, however, allow me to see if I want to go back to school for nursing. Aside from this, I'm looking at recruiter jobs in the tech sector since it seems to be better paying, have a bit more balance to it, and would still let me play to my strengths of interpersonal skills.As you can probably tell, I'm all over the place and still figuring out my long term career goals. I'm also seriously considering the military, but that's something I know I won't be doing for a "balanced" lifestyle, haha.All advice and suggestions are appreciated!
8kxqc1	1526871675	422	6 months ago, I left my job of 5 years and joined a new company where, at the time, I felt would be a good career move. Since early March, I have been feeling differently and finding myself becoming more exhausted, tired and less motivated at my job. At first, I thought this might be a temporary feeling and this feeling would go away but it’s been negatively impacting the quality of my work and causing me to make mistakes. This feeling is foreign to me and I have been trying out new work styles to help improve but it’s still not working.Two weeks ago, I had a meeting with my manager where she brought up these issues. Some of the other managers in the company reached out to her and mentioned the mistakes they noticed. She let me know that this has been causing some of our managers to question the need for our department and that things need to change. During our meeting, I acknowledged the issues I’ve been dealing with and the action plan I put together to help put me back on track. Since this meeting, I have been doing my best to be more detail oriented with my work and to focus more on the areas where my common mistakes were. Unfortunately, this has also caused me to feel more stressed and pressured to improve at work that I missed an important item during one of our meetings last week.I have been looking at the EAP program in my company and applying some of the tips and advice they provided. While there has been some minor improvements, I don’t feel it has been good enough because every mistake I make overshadows everything else I have accomplished during the day.I hate this feeling and I hate that I’m continuing in this downward spiral. I’m a good worker and this isn’t common behaviour for me. This is the first time I have felt that my career is in jeopardy and I’m terrified I may get fired for the lack of improvement I have been displaying in my work. I’ve been feeling more anxiety each passing day that I just want to curl up into a ball and cry. I don’t know what more I can do to help myself and I feel like such a failure.I want to improve on my performance and I want to stop letting down my department. Has anyone experienced anything similar? Can anyone offer me any guidance on how I can deal with this? 
8k1ap6	1526530089	93	I’m having a career burn out in tech as an engineer - I’m late 30s and not sure I can keep up with “the kids” coming out of college.  This is worsened by the fact that my industry is fueled by younger mindsets, so I feel like I’m constantly learning new things and forgetting everything else.  Is this common for those with 15+ years?  Should I call it a day and start moving into engineering management, lessening my code skills?  Even in this direction, will I still feel the burnout?
8i8ie7	1525892464	266	I’m 36 and for several years I have been dreaming about changing my career. Since I was 24, I have been a software and database developer, I basically write computer code all day everyday. I have not been passionate about my field for several years now, however, I continue to stay in it because I have a family to support and the pay is good. I’m bored and tired of being glued behind a computer screen all day. I have changed companies 3 times to see if that would make a difference and re-energize me, but it doesn’t. It’s just more of the same.I have come to the conclusion that I need something different. The burnout from the corporate IT world has left me feeling empty. I don’t really know what I want, but I do know I would like to have a little fun and work more closely with people. I know that I don’t want to work on anymore long complicated projects. I have been pondering becoming a grade school teacher. I like the idea of working with kids and teaching, but I know from reading about teachers that  it’s a tough job and not everyone is cut out for it. I think it would be fun to be a teacher and I like the idea of a beginning and end to a school year, along with a summer break, and a fresh new school year. I think it would be a rewarding job.Does anyone here have some advice to give me in regards to moving from IT into teaching, or even something else?
8apd1q	1523186649	134	I have seen this coming for a while but this summer I intend to leave my job as a science teacher. Mainly for burnout reasons, but without going into too much deatils its also because I feel that I have lossed my passion for teaching in its current format. I need to move on, but I am at a total loss about where to go next. I have never had another professional career outside of teaching, but I have done numerous jobs, including photography, warehouse work, catering and some bar work. I am a hard worker who has dedicated the last year to trying to work smarter in terms of prioritising my time. I know that my first task is getting a professional CV sorted, but what career pathways would you guys suggest?  
89piak	1522849008	357	Hello there,I am about to finish my degree and to find entry-level positions, but the job search and my qualifications due to my degree make me:a)	doubt my value on the job market b)	doubt what a first job should be not too get limited right awayBackground:Msc (Research-focussed) in Cognitive NeuroscienceMost valuable skills:Advanced Data Analysis in R, SPSSBehavioural and Neuroscientific research methodology, Survey etc.Excellent in Writing &amp; Presenting (I have won prizes for public speaking)I do not want to stay in academia – that topic is pretty much over for me.Ideally, I would like a role in which I help make tangible decisions using a data-driven approach. I enjoy conducting research, analyzing data and presenting them. I have really good communication and presentation skills, and I love working on challenging topics. I also would like to start working for a big/well-known firm to build both skills and reputation.However, this is my problem:I (assume to) have (significantly) more data, statistics &amp; statistical programming background than most people in business degrees, but are far from the skills of CS masters and/or data scientists. Jobs or internships that require either business knowledge (that I lack) or excellent data scientists skills (which I yet not have) reject me. I want to build technical skills, i.e. programming and data analysis, but I also do not want to become a data scientist and work 8h+ behind a PC. So I looked for positions that are less technical, like data analytics, but they often require (considerable) work experience unless they are at a tiny unknown firm. Also I would not want to start in HR positions, because they tend to lock you into HR. My biggest fear is to do a job that either locks me in or does not have enough reputation/teach skills that will let me progress into bigger firms later on.I thought about consulting etc., but I am coming from a burnout and am nowhere near working 50-60h a week. I am very productive and ambitious, but right now I do 40h/week at best.I would really appreciate advice regarding what positions, internships or general job description I should be looking out for.Thanks so much!
86pg3r	1521850572	198	I am a CNC machinist. I was a pretty good one when it worked night shift and had basically no life outside of work. For about 6 years I went into work at about 3 came home at 11 surfed the net for a few hours until I fell asleep and got up just in time to do  again. I eventually got laid off and tried university. I was a mediocre student and had to drop out when I ran out of money because no one will give me an interview for a non trades job and there are basically no part time trades jobs. I went back on the night shift for a while and when I was offered a position on days I tool it. Then I burned out in 6 months because I can't handle both a job and a life. The pattern repeated itself a few more time since then.At this point I can either look for night work and give up my hobbies and social life. Or keep pushing towards burnout. Going to school is not an option because I am not qualified for any job that a student could fit around school.
86lbai	1521817433	315	Tl;Dr - I (30F) have a competing job offer and a current colleague of mine wants me to stay and is promising me a position, but not until July. Basically asking what it will take for me to stay and wait it out in my current role. I don't know what to say. I have been at Company A for over 2 years in my current role. It's challenging and fun work, but chaos and my manager is unorganized and will throw anyone under the bus. The stress and workload has only increased and without any compensation increase, I am approaching burnout. I like Company A overall and I get to work with different department a lot and I would like to transfer there. Unfortunately, there is no head count until July. Company B contacted me for a role and after 3 rounds of interviews, offered me the position. Slightly higher pay, and more autonomous work, similar responsibilities. I asked my current colleague (the one in the other department of company A, that I work well with) to be a reference. He did and when I told him I had an offer, he went to his manager and discussed a role in their department that they would like to give me. However, we are on a fiscal year schedule and the position wouldn't be available until July. I met with him to discuss what I am thinking of doing, and he asked me what I would need to be reassured that the position is coming, and to stay with Company A in my current role until then. I don't know what to say/do. Do I ask for money? Can I? Should I get it in writing? Do I just leave company A and if the role at Company B sucks, do I try and get recruited back? Any thoughts or advice would be great, thanks!

84q7zf	1521149829	528	OK, so basically I have a bit of a difficult situation. I'm moving on from a job because the company is a complete shitshow, online business set up in 2015, ran by millennials in their early 20s (I'm in my early 30s), built quite largely on abuse of copyright and violations of Terms of Service of online platforms they use to conduct their business on. I do _not_ agree with their policies and do not want to be involved with them anymore as once I got a fairly good understanding of how they operate (took me a few months), I came to the conclusion that they are _toxic_. I have quite a good reputation in the industry myself, so naturally it is quite damaging for me to be involved in a business that is _a bit_ murky (to say the very least). I have had some great results during my time there, which is something I want to take from the unfortunate circumstances I found myself in, and I have really been working myself out to the max for the past year (naively thinking it might get me promoted and I might be able to improve certain processes in the company - never happened), this as much as I could considering the toxic environment I was in. I can't really just nuke it from my CV and pretend like it never happened, because within all craziness that's been going on, I managed to get some objectively good results and hit some very decent KPIs, without employing the tactics they do.**How do I spin this all in a job interview, however?** I have had several interviews so far and when I played my cards open and told prospective employers how it is, the whole thing about how they operate and how I do not agree with their abusive policies, lack of due diligence, the fact they got me to the point of burnout where I had to have been signed off by a doctor for stress and anxiety, I had the impression that the interviewers were taken aback and did not like it (I did not get the jobs at the end either, so…). What should I say?To add spiciness to the story, the company itself is actually quite well known in its business, has decent business relationships and generally a great opinion on the outside (for now), furthered by multiple awards and accolades they've received. Unfortunately, it is one thing on the facade, and an **entirely** different company behind the scenes - several really great and talented people left recently having been mopped around by managers, burned out like myself, signed off with depression because of rude/inconsiderate/unexperienced "Managers" who are barely out of uni — this all makes it even more difficult to talk about, because some of the companies I am interviewing for are (or have been) working with my former employer, and people I speak to are genuinely surprised by how bad it is behind the scenes compared to their own experience they've had while dealing with them.Any kind of advice would be greatly appreciated - and would be immensely helpful in my job search. Thank you!
7wofrh	1518298890	185	Im currently a software consultant making 70k a year. My responsibilities are a mix of technical troubleshooting with the software and custom configuration but it is very client facing. I want to break into wealth management (not necessarily financial advisor but more so high net worth individuals). Would my 1 year and some change experience consulting along with one of my two majors in undergrad being finance be enough to get my foot in the door? Is it plausible that I could make this switch without taking a pay cut? Should I worry about it looking bad on my resume to only have been consulting for 1 year (I know its high burnout so I feel its somewhat normal). And lastly, how should I spend my time from now until making the change to best position myself to be an attractive candidate? I feel I already have strengths in client communication, expectation management, calming fears, prioritizing issues, etc from consulting as well as (some) tech skills from being focuses in the software space with my financial skill set being more so from undergrad. Any advice, thanks?!
7rqy7t	1516461757	478	The golden handcuffs are real. I'm a RECE who has been working for about 3 years in preschool and I realize this is not for me in the longterm. I'm lucky to be working in a centre that pays about $25 an hour, with raises of almost $1 every year. I still love working with the children, but I find the ratio and responsibilities overwhelming (1 teacher to 8 children, with 32 total in class). It's a very demanding job, and some days I wish I could just work from home; I'm an introvert, and I think that factors in to the overwhelm because at the end of the day/week, the only self-care I have the energy for is sitting alone at my computer, possibly playing some video games.I started late in the game to finding my career as I'm 35 now with no large savings to my name. This is weighing on my mind as well as the thought of 3-4 years in university taking yet more time away from me creating a foundation for myself adds to the overwhelm. I also feel embarrassed that I'm not enjoying this as much as I thought I would, but as silly as it sounds, when I went into the Early Childhood Development course, I was more interested in child development itself than teaching, and thought I could do more than that upon finishing.I'm particularly passionate about the emotional development of children, and enjoy working with the children who have difficulties with executive functioning and emotional control. I enjoy doing observations of the children's behaviours, and thinking of creative ways to teach them more age-appropriate skills. I wonder if some sort of career towards doing just that, one-on-one in a preschool/kindergarten environment, would be more for me, but what? Does that field exist? Can I do it already with my college degree? Simultaneously I think about going in a completely different direction and either making videos (RECE/classroom related) or streaming (video games) to try and make a career for myself. Honestly my thought process there is simply because I miss being home and alone a lot of the time, but neither thought seems that realistic. Especially where streaming video games is concerned, the overwhelm only hits me again because as a registered ECE I have to be careful of everything I do or say even outside of work; it feels like I have to be Mary Poppins and, sorry, I'm not! My patience because of my looming burnout seems to be dwindling though and I feel like I need to make a move soon. At least in this field I could drop my hours easily and work part time/on call instead while I do other things but the money is good; the stability is good, I'm just stuck at that point where I can't decide what direction to go from here.
7esuvz	1511373523	205	So background on my experience/"expertise" - I graduated with a Kinesiology degree (minor in psych) in 2015. After working with a prominent Instagram "influencer" remotely , I became interested in influencer and digital marketing. Since then I've been working at one of the bigger media agencies, specializing in digital. I've worked on brands similar to Coca Cola, BMW, Mattel...except brands opposite of those. I've been promoted twice now, holding a "Senior Digital Specialist" title now. I run paid media on sites like YouTube, Facebook, Spotify etc. In terms of my personal interests, things I wish I could make a living doing is anything music related i.e movie/TV scores, sneaker marketing, cannabis marketing (since Canada is preparing for legalization). Additionally, I've written for, and still occasionally write for publications like Thought Catalog, Notable etc + my own blog. I truly enjoy writing so that area is of interest as well. I guess I'm looking for ideas around what to do next. I have a lot of interests, most that I can't capitalize on given my educational background and lack of experience. Agency life is gruelling and I'm passed the burnout point, I just don't care anymore so I'd rather get out and maintain my reputation here. TIA
7bs2sk	1510216028	355	I work for a non-profit which is operating on a very tight budget. I've been with them for over a year. I love the non-profit, and I'm loved by them. They are working to expand my hours (~10/week currently), because they need to expand their operations, but specifically because they know they have a great employee who is willing and available and capable of enacting the vision without needing much supervision.At the same time, I get messages like "create this report, but while you're on front desk duty"... which I've already communicated is not the best time to sit and focus on crunching a lot of data. It's not like it's a bad idea on the part of the organization in consideration of its budget, but as an employee, I feel like this is such a crazy mixed message. I really enjoy this organization, and I understand their challenges, but I dislike the inconsistent attitude and the feeling of guilt every time I bill them for my hours worked. I have also had to fight to be paid the same rate for all my tasks (e.g. $15 for some things and $10 for others). My boss tends to decide how much I can work based on whether he has seen a budget report lately. If a sudden need arises, though, then the budget goes right out the window.I'm experiencing some burn out as a result of frustration at being treated this way, as well as frustration at my position/duties being routinely  misunderstood by coworkers. (Having to explain to others what I do, or don't... not the best self-esteem booster.) To my knowledge I don't have a written contract with this organization (!!!).Should I negotiate some kind of contract to smooth out the inconsistency, or should I just warm up the ol resume? I feel that I will probably run out of growth opportunities with them after another year or so. Two years tops. I'd feel badly about leaving them when they're trying to expand with the expectation that I'll be around... but the burnout is real.Any kind of input or insight would be really welcome.
77rsdn	1508565768	335	I'm 33, had a successful career in transportation and corporate management for fortune 500 companies (3 of them in the last 14 years).   I was clearing 100k easy at my last job - and then it happened - It was a long time coming, I was busting ass to make more money, get my bonuses, etc. I don't know how to why, but I just lost it.  I couldn't focus, I couldn't work, and I stopped caring about even the most simple day-to-day activities.  I spoke to a career therapist and after a few sessions and had concluded I had hit some sort of wall.  I had given so much of myself to my career that I had lost the important things in life.So I made a plan - I paid off all my debts (less mortgage), sold my high-priced car and bought a nice economy car that costs almost nothing, and I quit.  I can't ever imagine going back to working 6-7 days a week, ever.  The job I took with with a previous company I worked for, but instead of leadership, I'm just driving a delivery truck for 4 days on, 3 days off.  I make half of what I did, but I'm happy.  I can't even explain how much happier I am.  But I feel as though I mailed in my career.  I left a management career for a labour and blue-collar one.  My business degree is worthless in my current role, so that is a bit of a waste...Where do I go from here?  Should I take 6 months or so to get my headspace back (as my therapist recommended) and see if I can make it work again?  Or should I change direction, or just keep doing what I'm doing and trade the big income for happiness? I feel like I left behind a ton of prestige and potentially my career, but I don't really regret it....

How did you get to where you are today?Also sorry I'm not articulating myself well it's 6am here and I'm just thinking...
725ii9	1506265523	684	I'm not sure if I want to pursue a career in HR, so I'm wondering about what else may out there that fits with my experience, education and interests.I'm currently working as a HR Assistant. It's my first ever job in the field and I've been in this role for 10 months. I enjoy most parts of my job and I've learned a lot, but I'm questioning a long-term career in this field. I see the responsibilities my manager has (HR Director) and I don't want to deal with some of the things she does. They don't interest me, and I'm happy they're not my responsibility, but that makes me wonder how much I can, or am willing, to advance in the field. In order to have a liveable salary, I'd need to advance and take on more responsibilities, which is something I want, but only to a point (don't want Director's job). It seems that there might be a cap on how far I can advance before I start to hate what I’m doing, but that said, I also need enough money to survive and live comfortably (not luxuriously). I guess I'm evaluating my options before I put too much time into this field and find it too difficult to leave and start over again. I've read that people leave HR after a number of years, anyway, due to burnout, or other reasons, so I'm having doubts about my decision to pursue this field. I like the structure of HR, and how it's driven by policy and procedure. It takes away a lot of the guesswork and ambiguity. I also like that this field acts as a resource (no pun intended) to people by problem solving and offering solutions. I am drawn to the helping aspect of the field, along with the structure, and I like working with people. I like that there are many different avenues to explore, but I worry about compensation, burnout and general interest in certain areas and/or tasks. I have been told that I have the right personality for HR, and so far it seems like a good fit, but like I said, I have my doubts and I wonder if there's something else that's a better fit. For my background, I have a BA in Psychology and a Master's in Social Work. The degree in Social Work was a mistake, but I honestly thought it was the right decision at the time. I had one job in Social Work working in a mental health agency that lasted for 4 months before I got fired, and that was honestly for the best. Social Work is stressful and overwhelming, the pay sucks, burnout is real, and I realized that I need to work with something more concrete than emotions, and I need to see results. In counseling, change happens slowly, and you don't necessarily see it happening. I realized too late that I can't handle not being able to see results after putting in the necessary effort, so all things considered, it ain't for me. Six months later, I was working as a bank teller, and I did that for nearly 4.5 years before taking my current job. I didn't necessarily dislike being a teller, but there was no room for growth if I wanted it, I didn't like the bank I worked for, the pay is terrible, and banking is becoming increasingly sales-driven, which I hate. I never wanted to be in banking; it was just a job.So that brings me to the present. What else can I realistically do with my education and experience? Banking is out, along with Social Work/counseling/anything in that related field. I do not want to return to school, and I'm open to learning new things. I understand that my salary would not be anything to write home about in the beginning, as is usually the case when you start over, but as long as the opportunity is there to earn more with time and experience, and live a comfortable lifestyle, I can deal with that. I appreciate any help/advice that comes my way!
6x7yzg	1504197364	808	**The short of it:*** Option A is my preferred and probably the best for my career, but it isn't currently available, it isn’t guaranteed, and it has no timeline. I'm told the odds look great, but this is second-hand.* Option B is the best short-term choice (depending) in case A became available, and it has a pending offer. It would potentially offer a lot of experience, but I have zero control or say over projects, location, or duration (it's like a temp job with a full-time salary). Not loving it.* Option C is my best long-term choice, especially if A takes a long time or doesn’t happen, but I won’t know if I receive an offer until the end of today or tomorrow. The pay is lower than option B, but it is remote (I hate commutes) and I could see myself staying for a few years or so. It may be that I am reaching a point of burnout.**Overall, C is preferable to B, but B is still a better route to A. Neither A or C are guaranteed. Only B currently has an offer.****Fleshed-out version:**I moved to a new city at the beginning of August, and I found the perfect job opportunity (Option A). It would be challenging, I would be working under someone who would be the perfect mentor, and it would be in a niche that I am interested in pursuing. I made it through all the interviews and received praise for my performance on their assessment tests. Unfortunately, another opportunity that had been pending for months opened for this individual and he took it (same type of work at a new company with a better budget). Because he was building a team, his departure meant the position was no longer available. I started looking elsewhere and pinned down two other opportunities and now I find myself having to choose between them.However, late last week I found out that Option A may become available again, which makes the decision a lot more complicated. It would be with the same individual, but at the company he is moving into. I do not know anything more about the potential location or company. I am trying not to pry/be annoying, but I have been told he talks highly about me and that I would have a spot in his new team once he begins building it. I believe working with him would be the best opportunity for my career growth. However, this could be 3 months from now, 6 months from now, or not happen at all. I really don't have anything to work with at the moment.Option B would be a consulting-type job. It is basically a temp-job but with a full-time salary and benefits. Because it is project-based, I would be exposed to new systems and flesh out my resume. I'm not so happy with the pay they offered for what they're asking, and I would also have zero say in what I do. Project lengths vary greatly (2 months - 2 years with 4-9 months as an average), and I have to be okay with up to an hour commute one way (I don't know if that even includes rush hour traffic). This means I could end up with a 10-minute commute by train for a 3-5 month project, or I could have a 1 hour+ drive for a 9-12 month project. I truly have no say or influence. I guess it would be a chance to meet people, although I am an introvert. They want an answer by 3pm today (they officially offered me the position last friday).Option C is a step back from what I have been doing and would possibly be a step down in pay. I know it won't be higher than B. However, it is 100% remote, I wouldn't have to purchase business casual clothing (my last job was very casual), and I could use the downtime and time saved from not commuting to do education of my own on the side (which I need for what I am aiming to do with my career). If I took this position, I don't think I would feel comfortable leaving short of at least 9 months if A becomes available, but it really is the best long-term option in case A does not come through. It also is great in terms of future possibilities internally, and the company itself has been consistently rated a top place to work. I have a phone conversation with the VP at 1p, and they may have an answer by the end of the day today or tomorrow.I do not know if I suck it up and go with Option B, which would be more stressful but may be a better route for Option A, or if I go with Option C.Any thoughts/opinions would be greatly appreciated!
6x030n	1504108666	133	Currently, I am working at a local firm. It is a big firm. I am right at the bottom. However this firm also employs and promotes internally for higher up positions. I went to college while my friends have worked there since they left school. They are in higher up positions. I do enjoy the work and its a nice environment. However it will be a long time until I get considered. And I need more money.I have been offered a position in marketing. It pays very well. However it is a risk. It has high turnover, staff burnout, and you are competing against your peers. But I could easily make more money than my friends do.However If I leave, I will not be able to get that job back at the firm. 
6u1zkz	1502889718	338	Ok- Heres the current situation. I'm 26, working as a Customer service rep in a remote office of a startup company, making 40k. The job is basically getting yelled at by people who hardly have any education, and can hardly use a cellphone. I have one coworker, a 40 year old single mom. There is basically no room for advancement, and I don't get benefits (contract employee). I feel like i'm starting to burnout from getting yelled at for 8 hours a day, and not really having anyone to talk to other than my one coworker.I have been contemplating leaving this job for a while now. The problem- the backup plan. I have a Bachelors in Human Resource Management, and a real estate license. I have done a couple real estate transactions while working at my full time job, so option number one would be to quit and try real estate full time. I have a bunch of gig economy apps (Lyft/Uber, instacart, Wag etc) I could use to hold me over when I don't have many clients.Option number 2- My friend can guarantee me a job as an Amazon delivery driver. I would use a company van, and the company would pay for gas. I would make between 35-45k a year, and be considered a fte- benefits and PTO. There seems to be some room for advancement (you can become an operations manager eventually).Option 3- keep looking for a job that makes more than my current one, and utilizes my degree, while toughing out my current job.My main concern is making a decent amount of money. I have a wife who makes around 100k a year, so we could live off her salary, but I don't feel right not pulling my weight. I just don't want to end up quitting my job and making significantly less money than I am now, but i'm not sure how much longer i'm going to be able to take my current job.What should I do? Any advice or insight would be awesome.
6ri8up	1501821908	160	My first job was a at mobile game startup doing User Acquisition / Marketing and left after 2 years because of burnout (Working on call through nights and weekends). My current job is as an Accountant at a University, I've been in the role less than 6 months and working overtime each day.Although I've only had two jobs here in the Bay, I've talked to friends/family who seem to work quite a lot as well and the excuse is that it's the norm here. I'm not ok with it and want to change jobs because I believe that I work to live not vice versa. I want to find something where I work only 40 hours a week, is that possible here in the Bay?I'm interested in Marketing with a degree in Economics, but am open to hearing about other roles too.td;dr Is it possible for a work/life balance in the Bay? If so what roles/companies can I find this at?
6ms5w1	1499840654	348	I feel like I am learning nothing. I'm not utilizing my degree, and this is an academic internship. All they make me do is office work and go on coffee runs or do tasks that are not really related to the field. I can't stand this. I feel unvalued and am just there for free labor, although my contract says it's a mutual beneficial relationship where I am to be TAUGHT the ins and outs and to be treated like a real employee. It's extremely disorganized, my supervisor doesn't actually supervise me. It's a poor work environment in which no one's work is ever appreciated, but instead people are only told what they're doing wrong, or blamed for other people's mistakes. we work during lunch even though we have to clock out for it. People are petty and gossip or treat the interns like they're quite incompetent. I've tried telling my supervisor I need more hours for my degree, and I'd like to do more tasks. It does absolutely nothing. I'm sticking it out because I only have a few months left, but it's just so demotivating. I come up with ideas to make things easier--saving paper, making formats for documents since the previous person who ran the office would create documents in COMIC SANS and wouldn't use proper spelling/grammar. I'll show the mock up to my supervisor and she tells me not to change it, or if it's fixed, then someone else ruins it because they'll make a new version with more spelling mistakes. I asked to provide a (free) service for clients--which they want me to do for most people--but for this specific client they just laughed in my face because the client is "famous" and probably wouldn't want this service done. They won't even ask. I'm not really sure what to do anymore. I've started to dread going in to the office and am starting to feel the burnout. I cry every week because by the end of the week I feel miserable. How can I continue to motivate myself until this is all over? 
6hdq8a	1497515030	889	I am considering going on leave from or fully quitting my PhD program, and would like your advice. My undergraduate degree was in computer engineering, and I'm in my 4th year of doctoral studies, with my research in computational biology. I was a top-notch undergrad and am a moderately-successful PhD student, both at elite institutions, but I'm feeling burnt out and unmotivated.  I've started talked with my advisor about how I'm feeling a slump in my energy and motivation. While he's understanding and nice, his attitude is basically, "Yeah, this is a really hard stage that most PhD students go through, but you just push through it. You're mostly done, so work hard, propose this coming academic year, and get your PhD over with." At an intellectual level, this makes sense to me, but I'm just not feeling it in my gut. I want to go on leave for a year, but my advisor thinks this is a really bad idea. (Though we may have slightly different interests in this regard: he's coming up for tenure in a few years, and I'm his senior PhD student, so he probably wants to see me finish and get a nice academic position ASAP.)  The last time I talked about this with my advisor, I said I'd just push to finish my PhD, and forget about quitting or going on leave. But quite frankly, I've been more like the high school kid who's been pressured to participate in some sport by one's parents. I'm going into the lab every day, but only putting in 20% effort, only going through the motions to make my advisor happy and to not be a quitter. As a result, I'm just not productive, effective, or creative. In case it helps, here are the main factors in my burnout and demotivation. (The first sentences of the following paragraphs are TLDRs.) 1. I'm physically and mentally drained. I was academically perfectionistic and extracurricularly active in undergrad, and thus didn't sleep much. I also hit the ground running in my PhD program, spending 40+ hours/week on research even while taking classes.  Now I just feel like I have zero s###s left to give. For any fellow tennis fans out there, I think I'm going through a Djokovic-like slump these days. 2. I've become cynical about my research field. My initial career goal was to become a professor, but not any more. I don't trust the accuracy of the methods that I'm developing. Even worse, I don't think that the methods I'm developing actually answer questions that truly matter to biologists or that might enable improvements in medicine. My methods papers are just cited by other computational biologists in their own introduction / related work sections. My subfield is basically a circlejerk, and I'm sick of participating in this madness.  3. I've found it hard simultaneously taking on two arduous problems and self-esteem wrecking balls: modern love and doctoral research. I had a difficult long-term relationship breakup a year ago, and I've had precious little dating success since then. I know at 26 years old I'm perhaps too young to feel this way, but at this point in my life, all I really want is to have a nice-paying programming job, then to get married, buy a house, and have kids. This has been a major distraction for me, and my mind floats to it constantly when I'm trying to do research. I feel miserable, jealous, and demotivated when I go on Facebook, and see less ambitious and talented peers from my age cohort posting engagement, marriage, and baby pictures. I do understand that going on leave or quitting my program won't directly translate into any of these things. That said, I suspect I would be able to increase my chances by relocating geographically, becoming less frazzled, and devoting more attention to my physical appearance and all-around dateability. (Also, please don't tell me that I should prioritize my career over my love life: I get to decide my own life priorities, not you.)  4. I'm regretting the financial implications of my choice to do a PhD, and I'm not sure how to best move forward. I had an upper-class upbringing even though my parents aren't particularly wealthy, so I have high expectations in terms of my long-term living standards and school district / opportunities for future children. I've missed out on hundreds of thousands in income, and I'm unsure how to catch up. Should I get a software engineering job now (ie stop digging and cut my losses), or finish my PhD and leverage it to get a higher-paying job in finance or consulting (ie dig my way out), or just restrict my dating choices to high income (ie marry my way out)? 5. I'm in the process of becoming Catholic, and doing so as a PhD student has been rough. Catholicism is very different from my background and outside the mainstream of my academic setting. This is taking a lot of my mental energy, as I spend my evenings reading and thinking about religion and spirituality, not getting excited about the latest research papers in my field. It's also been emotionally taxing and socially isolating, as my family and current friend circle aren't exactly supportive or understanding of this change in direction in my life.

63wfj3	1491518563	241	I went to school for illustration, and right out of school I've actually been successful. I've spent the past 2 years freelancing. But I'm so sick of being cooped up inside my house all day by myself, and I've realized I really don't like painting for other people. I want art to be something just for me again. So I've been thinking about "day jobs" I could get part-time to be my main source of income.Here's what I want:- working with other humans, outside of my home- helping other people / good cause- part-time work (10-30 hrs)- above minimum wage (30k/year is good)- not too extensive training needed (2 years max... I don't have lots of savings to pay for college again, but I could put together 10k if needed)I was considering tattoo artist, since that takes what I've been building with art, but I still get to be in a studio working with customers. Most tattoo artists are part-time anyway. But I don't have any tattoos and don't really want to get any, so that seems kind of strange.I was also considering massage therapist; it's an in-demand field, I'd only need a year of school, and I'd get to help people. But it's repetitive work with a 50-80% burnout rate, so that seems like a dumb idea. I'm an INTJ and I've been told to avoid redundant work. Retail makes me want to kill myself.Thank you for any ideas!!(edit for formatting)
63myc4	1491412758	269	Background: 22 years old female with a certificate equivalent to high school diploma. Not from the US. Have 3 years of retail experience in IT, working in a multinational company. Mastered 3 languages: English, Chinese and Malay (which is pretty useless, I know.)For the past few months I've been suffering from (possible) depression and my procrastination has gotten so bad that I take 1-2 mental days off  every month just to keep my shit together. After talking to a few wise friends I do agree with them that I might be suffering from a major burnout and it's time to look for a new job as there is absolutely no chance of an advancement in the company. After giving some thoughts I have two options: 1.  work for retail but try a new industry. I do think I have good fashion sense and would like to work in a luxury brand. From what I know, the pay is much better than what I earn and career advancement is more possible as job hunters like to recruit from such companies.2. Take 2-3 years working in a job which involves traveling. I'm thinking air stewardess or a tour guide. Yes I am aware that it's not as easy as just "work as you travel". It's not as glamorous as it looks on social media. Although I love traveling my concern is if I decide to take the second path I'm afraid of not being able to seek other jobs in the future as some employers may not take air stewardess/tour guides seriously. Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks!

5xyeex	1488861399	607	I've worked for this company for almost three years and it's more than doubled in size since then and is expected to double again by 2021. I recently started a position as an analyst after working in a different role and department for two years. I started in mid-September last year. Come November, my position got pulled into a brand new department, and I have since had to start wearing more hats, some of which give my work high visibility with the CEO and COO directly (althought I'm still about 3-4 levels beneath them).Today, one of the directors from my former department pulled me aside and said they were creating a new analyst position that would be working with data from my former position, and that I've been identified as a prime candidate for the role given my past and current experience. The gist of the conversation was, "it's yours if you want it". I would still have to go through the formal interview process to get the position, but it sounds like they really want me.I'm wondering if it's a good idea to accept this offer or not.Pros:My current boss isn't very good at being a boss. He's really smart but he's not very good at communicating. He also doesn't realize, and frequently downplays, my performance capability. My new boss, whom I've worked before, is a pretty nice guy. Obviously too, given that he has practically begged me to take this job, he recognizes my potential, and that might give me a better spotlight.I have a strong foundation of knowledge regarding the data I would be working with in the new position, which will likely help me stand out and make learning the new position a piece of cake.Most likely there will be a small pay increase, which I desperately need at the moment (unanticipated medical bills, won't go into detail).Another fancy title to add to my resume.Cons:Most likely less company visibility. My work might not reach as high up, I'm guessing that maybe occasionally some ad hoc reports might be passed as high as the COO but not further and not as frequently.The new position's department is not new, so there's no guarantee I'll have as much influence in guiding its growth (although with the position itself being new, I might have some influence).I've done some of the work that I would be taking on when I was still in my previous role, and I don't enjoy it. It's a little tedious. It wouldn't be the only work I'd be doing, but likely a significant percentage. Perhaps though since I wasnt being paid anything extra to do it before, that might be why I didn't enjoy it. So maybe if the pay is right I can get comfortable with it.I'm worried about burning bridges and disrupting the flow with my current job, department, and superiors. The new department is still in its infancy, and I'd be abandoning it fairly early, which may/may not irritate some people.I would likely still have to work two jobs until I could be replaced, which may lead to long nights, burnout, etc. I'm usually pretty good about handling heavy workloads, but my company has a notoriously slow hiring process, and things might get old after a couple months.After reviewing the pros and cons listed above, I'm considering that given my current salary of $53,000, that I shouldn't make a lateral move for anything less than $58,300. I would like to have other feedback before I make a decision though. If you think that number's too low, or if I should consider other factors as well, please let me know.Thanks in advance!
5v5a3g	1487606270	173	I left a corporate management job in January after having a meltdown due to a severe lack of work/life balance combined with an extremely negative work environment.  I took 3 weeks off, did some travelling, and started a new job last week in a lower paying lower responsibility position.Problem is that I just don't feel motivated to go.  The trainer is terrible, but I've had worse.  The people are nice and the job is low stress (although technically I could get a call at any time, it rarely happens). The commute is longer but I listen to podcasts so I'm not bothered by it.  By all accounts this is what I was looking for, an easier role that allows me to step back a bit, but I just don't even feel like showing up.  I'm not sure what to do, I've been in leadership for the past 10 years and I can usually push through anything.  I don't even know the job yet and I'm already feeling antsy.Tips?
5k1ivs	1482556247	269	I [32M] have decided after four years as a public school teacher in the United States to leave the profession to start a new career. I have been a middle school special education teacher and service coordinator and I’ve really started to burnout—despite a promising start. Actually, I’ve anticipated this, and I am already two-thirds through an MBA program; I have undergraduate degrees in Marketing and Education (Learning Behavior Specialist). (When can I start ;-) I have already talked to my boss about transitioning to a new career, as he has noticed that I’ve been struggling with general day to day exhaustion; also depression brought on by the crushing workload has been sinful, too. I’m ready to move on, but I really don’t know what direction to take next—I feel very torn and unsure of how I can utilize my skills, experience, and education. Also, I’m going through this crisis where I feel it necessary to use my passion for music. I've taught and performed classical and jazz guitar in both Chicago and Phoenix. So, what are some good career avenues for past teachers? I also have sales experience while working for both small and large companies. I’ve been thinking HR as a way to couple my recent experience with my new business education and background. Despite being as confused as I was in my early 20’s, I’m excited and I really don’t have to replace a big salary. What success have you heard from other former educators? A proffesor from my master's program mentioned higher ed. be a good route for me; the pay isn't great, though. Thank you!
5gc50e	1480803880	657	I was pretty lucky with my career. Stumbled into a startup early, sold it for decent return, got acquired by a major entertainment company. Rose the ranks quickly, am now a lower-mid level executive after 6-7 years (manager of managers of managers) with a large team of engineers.Trouble is, being an acquisition, we are a remote office, and the main company's division has been in free fall and contracting for 6 years now. This makes us extremely vulnerable. We have survived over 11 rounds of major layoffs in 6 years without being affected (the only group who hasn't) but the threat of shutdown is blatant and constant. The company runs entirely on "relationships" (i.e. politics), not actual performance metrics, and surviving these layoffs has taken an extreme amount out of me and is slowly crushing my soul.I am massively overpaid, mostly as a bribe in the form of retention payouts to keep me from quitting. Senior execs have directly threatened they will shut the place down if I walk. Keeping us open makes them look good, so as long as I keep doing this we're probably okay, but it's a quarter by quarter battle and it's just slowly ruining me.This is not the kind of work I wanted for a career and the actual tech skill atrophy is starting to worry me. Unfortunately the work is too crushingly unending to carve out time to tinker or get those skills back on the side. By the time I get home, all I have the energy to do is stare at the wall and/or try to sleep.What mostly keeps me there is the sense of duty to the people who work for me, and wanting to protect them, and a sense that I will have failed them if I can't take it anymore. I feel like the only reason I'm lucky to be in this senior position is because of their skills and effort, and so I feel an enormous sense of duty to put them first.But at this point, I've hit extreme physical and mental burnout that not even a vacation can solve. The moment I walk in and sit down in the morning again I feel hopeless, depressed, anxious, and like I want to flee. Doctors are telling me I am ruining my health from the mental strain, despite good diet and exercise, and pharmaceutical help to sleep at night.Trouble is, 60+ people's jobs are counting on me, and any other job I got at this level would probably pay less than half as much. My question is, at what point is the answer to leave and look after my own health for a bit? Versus should I just suck it up for the money and for their sakes? All the other execs seem to only look out for themselves and feel no similar sense of loyalty to their people, but I just don't have the personality for that.Are all executive jobs like this? Should I just be sucking it up, because this is just how it is? Would I just be leaving for something that pays less but has the same amount of stress? Or should I consider a major career reset to something outside of management?Is it worth trying to bring up the burnout and intention to leave with senior management? Or is that career suicide either way? Is the right/cleaner answer just to give notice and quit without explaining why?Should I make sure I have another job lined up first, or is it okay to just quit first and find something later? I'm not sure I have it in me to both do this job and be interviewing at the same time at 100%. I have enough cash on hand to live without a job for at least a few years, but not sure if having a gap in the resume at this level would be a bad idea.Thanks for any advice you can give.
5b2lq0	1478251371	423	Just to give some background, I am a data scientist based in London; I am still young but very qualified. My last two jobs were awful (the kind of environments where it is common to get a burnout, although I managed to avoid that), so the last time I was changing job I decided to work in a small start-up. I have been working there for one year, the management is much nicer than in my previous positions, but it is a small company and we work a lot. Being the only data scientist, I single-handedly manage all the R&amp;D and most of the advanced reporting that we do for our clients. My bosses are very happy about my work.The market here is still very good for data scientist (I personally think that things may change in the event of a hard Brexit) so I get a lot of offers from recruiters. I did a few interviews and I am starting to get alternative offers. As I see it, the cons of the current position are:- Salary is not high (£40k per year, no equities/options/benefit/ pension scheme) compared to the market value for data scientists.- We work a lot (we are in a shared workspace and we clearly work more than most other startups there). In addition, if I work overtime I am not paid or compensated (and I sistematically do work overtime since we have a lot of stuff piling up).- I was hired to do data science, yet most of my time is spent on more BI/reporting stuff, which is not interesting and not necessarily good for my future career. This may change at some point of the future but it is not sure when.- I work alone on most stuff, so I can't ask for help if I am overloaded.While the pros are:- Working alone I make a lot of experience and I am clearly responsible for all the successful projects.- The bosses are the first I found that treat me as a human (but I know I was unlucky in the past).- If the company grows, I will probably be promoted to head of data science/analytis/whatever.I am still not sure what is the best option for my career. I have the feeling that as it is now it is not worth all my effort, but at the same time the company may make it and grow nicely (although I can't be sure I will reap any benefit if it happens).Any thought?TL,DR: overworked, underpaid, but nice bosses. Should I change job?
54r9vn	1474992219	677	While I jumped around a lot in college as far as career ideas, the one I toyed with the most was becoming a professor. I decided late last 2015/early 2016 that while it really would be a nice career, and I think grad school could be a fun way to spend my twenties, I do not want to pursue it due to job prospects and other reasons. This meant I had to accent my B.A. in Philosophy some to be a competitive applicant. For a college grad my resume isn't terrible, I have worked at a law firm doing case research (legal assistant), been a marketing intern for a campus outreach program, wrote for the school's economics magazine, completed research in an organic chemistry lab which resulted in my name on a paper(I went through a pre-med phase) and worked as a line cook all throughout college to pay the bills. I also began to teach myself Python last December, making slow progress.I applied to about 50 jobs in the spring in a panicky, "I'm going to graduate with 35k debt in 8 weeks and I have no definitive plans!" frenzy. I was trying to use the qualitative and quantitative research experience I have from the law firm and lab coupled with my writing skills to get a job as a research associate as a D.C. think tank, or non-profit. I heard back from a company in Boston offering me a part-time job, and got 2 rejections letters. I understand that I was inexperienced at writing cover letters and tailoring my resume, so I wasn't too let down.I decided to teach English in South Korea for year (I arrived in Seoul in August) to save some money, pay down my student loans, travel a bit, and use the free time to work on skills for jobs. My one year goal is to become proficient (read: not an expert, but ahead of the curve) in Python and Google Analytics, familiar with another language (C++, Javascript, Ruby, or R) and try to build a small portfolio of projects I've completed. After my year in South Korea is up (Aug 2017), I want to move to a bigger city like Denver, D.C., Boston, or Seattle with the money I've saved.I mentioned knowing what I want to do.. The truth is I know what I like doing and I need help figuring out the career for me. I still like the idea of working for a political think tank, and I think with more "hard skills" to pair with my liberal arts degree I would have a better chance. I'm thinking of journalism as well, maybe even "data journalism." I have also thought about trying to get an internship or even a position as a junior data analyst for some company as well. I really like thinking hard about problems, imagining solutions, and writing about them- it's why I studied philosophy. What are other fields that would use the mixture of hard and soft skills I'll have in a 8 months when I'm applying for jobs in the U.S. again? I kind of want to work in something at least tangentially related to public or foreign policy, because I find it interesting.If I felt like I could handle teaching for two years, I might consider staying in Korea, because at the end of 24 months here I will have just turned 24, I can have paid off over 18k in student loans, saved up 5k+ in cash, and done a lot of traveling (I've made an excel sheet to make a budget, and predict all of this based on my spendings and monthly salary). I would be scared of becoming a less desirable applicant though, as well as suffering from burnout here.Sorry for writing so much, I think I just wanted to write my story down to get it off my chest.**TL;DR:** Liberal arts grad is learning some programming to broaden his skill set. He likes writing, problem solving, researching, and learning new things. Give him some advice or insult his B.A.
4otz4l	1466353692	582	This is something that I've contemplated for several months now, and believe that the "right time" could be near to make the move of turning in my notice.Some background: I took a job that I had a feeling may not be a great fit but had just been laid off after many years at a prior company. It was a good idea to take it anyway, and I've been *performing* very well, according to my boss.However, I have a lifelong anxiety disorder, which has since become more unmanageable, and which I am seeking treatment for. It has made each day a struggle, as I find some aspects of the job overwhelming for me at this point in time to the point I'm very depressed on certain days. I won't go into detail except that I can say with confidence that there may be jobs of a better fit, at least temporarily as I work on getting better.It has been six months, and several months of misery but holding out because I don't want to do anything rash.Now, my husband was just promoted and we will have a boost of extra income, about $15k a year plus possible bonuses. This would help. We are able and willing to downsize from the home we currently rent which is pricey since we could afford it at the time. We would be just as happy in a different location of the city that might simply be cheaper bc of the location itself. There are expenses we can cut back on as well. I do have about $15k saved up which is enough to get me by for at least six months. I am also a freelance writer, and have enough experience that finding freelance opportunities would provide some extra income. I've been applying for other jobs this weekend like a maniac, in the hopes I can secure something before I feel the effects of burnout much longer. Even if it pays quite a bit less.It is a confusing time, because my gut says to just do it and give myself a needed break, but my more logical practical side knows that we can't always just do things like that. I've always been a responsible person for the most part in jobs, and had many over the years that I could handle. It's a tough time.If I decide to make the move, I'm wondering what to say to my supervisor. He is a very perceptive person, and we have a great relationship and he told me last week how much he values my work and wants me to stay on. I'm just a terrible liar, but I cannot, of course, tell him that an anxiety disorder is the reason I need to take a break. "Personal reasons" or stress sounds so evasive and strange, as I really value honesty in my exchanges with him, and I fear it may bite me in the butt later if a recruiter spoke to him. I would like it if I could explain that I'm more than willing to stay on until we can train a replacement, however long it takes. The thought of knowing it can end soon would be a relief in itself.Tl/dr- Does anyone have tips on quitting a job amicably for reasons others may not understand, but you know it needs to be done for yourself? Sorry for the wall of text too, perhaps a part of the anxiety :) thank you to anyone who read this 
4om1cx	1466206301	604	Hi everyone!First of all, please forgive my english, this is not my native language.That said, first I'm going to tell you my problem, then a brief resume of my experiences, and then what I think i need/want.Around 2011 I started working as a plumber assistant, something entirely different from what I have been doing previously; and since then I've been promoting myself (in a manner of speaking) to a kind of partnership with my ex bossand now we have a small construction company. We've been building houses and such, from scratch to the very end. I've learned a lot, and economically I go from good, to sometimes very good, and sometimes 4 months in a row eating potatoes every day.The problem is that I do not really like this job, at all. I hate the lack of stability, I hate to going out every damn day, froze myself in the winters, pick up the shovel and start digging, dreaming with the next building step, just to repeat the thought when in that next step, over and over again. And the worse of all is my partner, it has a kind of bipolar attitude, plus a very bullying personality that is truly annoying, and i found myself at a brink of shoveling his head every moment.I need a career change urgently.That's the problem, now I'm telling you who I am.I started working at 14 as a caddy in a large golf club, then in a car washing company, every day when I got out of high school, I would go and clean cars till past dark, frozen fucking water, anyway, then I started repairing PCS, the basic, anti-viruses, basic hardware repair, etc. Then, I took CCNA from Cisco, while doing the second semester, I worked as a IT guy in a small company of technology. Then dropped CCNA, cant afford it anymore. Thats when I went to the "Big City", stayed with a friend family for a year. At IBM academy I took a 10 months "UNIX System Administrator" training, and then, because of external reasons, I couldn't get the promised job at IBM (neither the other 64 students, it was a big failure year for the company in my country). Then I went back to my city, and started working in what I'm now, construction.I have been thinking, all this time, about my dreamed job, and that would be something related to IT, UNIX/Linux sysadmin, or soft/web developer, for what I have been reinforcing my very basic coding skills (shell scripting, basics of C) with codeacademy  java, html and CSS classes. The ideal, the perfect job would be a remote job. I'm sick of people, I think I'm what you guys call "burnout".Well, thats my point of view, I would really appreciate any advice you could give me, share your experiences, thoughts.I'm from Argentina,and live in the Andes mountains, so the IT work is reduced to very few options, all of very high level, nothing Jr. or even starter.I've been sending resumes for the past year and a half, but with no results, plus the country is in economical crisis... So I look into an international remote job.I would be a king with a  $8/hr, 8h/day, 5 day/week ratio...PS: I forgot to add that I'm studying telecommunications engineering at college, but had to pause (kind of drop) this year because it got impossible with my job to keep up classes, but i got very good grades (in fact, almost promoted every class I took, something I'm proud of considering I attend from 18 to 23/24 while working from 830 to 17 :P)Thank you!!!

3zxpqt	1452203226	763	I am looking for advice. My thoughts are jumping around a bit, so this might be slightly disjointed and long, but I will try to keep it fairly concise. I am using a throwaway, for privacy concerns. Currently, I am feeling trapped in an un-fulfilling job. I wouldn't say I am over-qualified, but I am clever and my collections job is repetitive and boring, but pays pretty well. This might not be too bad if it weren't for all the problems - there are just constant problems, mostly with our billing, that take forever to resolve. I have customers who have invoices on their account with tens of thousands of dollars in billing that is incorrect that we are dragging out feet in correcting.I was promised during my last two reviews that if I kept up my hard work I would be looking at a promotion to a supervisor, and they “had big plans for me”, but there has been no indication that any kind of advancement is coming up and someone else (with about 3 months of seniority) has been made a supervisor in the meantime, leaving no real need for another.I have tried to move departments, but the first time, HR says they never got my application (despite my telling my HR rep the following morning that I submitted it), and the second time, the position was put on hold and I was told that the hiring manager is leaning towards another candidate.People in other departments who know me think I am very capable and intelligent, but I cannot seem to get a foothold in with any advancement here.I am just sick to death of all the problems that no one wants to fix and I can tell that in general I am burnt out here. I don’t like the work I do and I am just not able to use any kind of critical thinking in my job, so I am trying to find something outside of my current company. The problem is – I don’t know what I want to do. I am not pushy, so I don’t like sales (or collections for that matter) and I would rather see myself doing something that feel good about or maybe find a little bit fun or interesting. I just cannot seem to find a job that interests me. I studied Psychology, but I can’t really do anything with it with only a BA.Last year I spent about 10 months applying to jobs but didn’t hear back from any of them. I don’t claim to have an amazing resume, but I have sent it to my friends to proofread and evaluate and none of them had any major gripes about it, so I mean, there is no blaring issues with the resume itself. Another big problem is pay – I currently make a pretty decent salary, about $50k/year, which is not huge, but very comfortable. I can afford pretty much all of my bills with a little money available for hobbies and activities, but most of the jobs in my area that I am qualified for would be a significant paycut – somewhere between 15-20k, which is just a massive portion – maybe if I was going from 115k to 100k, or maybe even from 85k to 65k might be worth the job change, but for me, this would be a huge change in lifestyle and I just haven’t found a job I feel passionate enough about to make this huge pay cut seem worth it. Most of what I’m seeing is Sales or Customer service, Home Health Aides, or Receptionists.I was worried I might just not like anything because I am lazy and just don’t want to work, but I don’t think that’s it – I work very hard at the job I am in. I try to go above and beyond in my position and I am often here late when others cut out right as their shift ends. I get a lot of fulfillment in doing a good job, so I think I just want to do work I like, not just robot phone calls.I don’t know – I realize that without knowing me, my history, my likes, my qualifications, etc, that it is very difficult to make suggestions about what I would be happier doing, but I am really struggling with burnout and I go back and forth between apathy and anger when I am at my current job. I like music and animals, but I don’t really like working directly with lots of people.Anyone have any advice?
3v8zvs	1449123187	556	Throwaway because my company is easily identifiable through my main account.I just started my first full-time software engineering job this September, after a string of internships. I started right at the end of Q3, so Q4 marks my first real performance review. Our company gives out annual raises in January. Since I haven't been working here for too long, I wanted to make sure I was making the most of my few months in order to maximize that first raise. (I also really like the company and want to perform well, of course.)The VPE and I have a great working relationship. He's a strong leader, a great balance between being supportive and helpful without being too micromanaging. For the first two months he was my direct manager.When I first got this job, I was running full steam ahead. Kicking ass, working tons of hours, knocking out assignments left and right. VPE was very liberal in his praise of my ability to get shit done and respond quickly. Whoo!That kind of time commitment wasn't sustainable. For the past few weeks, I've slowed things down a little. This is due partially to burnout/needing to catch up on sleep and R&amp;R, and other personal factors (I actually have friends now that I like to hang out with, etc). It's also due to the type of work I've been doing - more longer-term projects that are outside of my domain expertise, rather than a bunch of little bugs that can be squashed within a few hours. Essentially, the past 3-4 weeks have seen lower levels of production than that initial crazy sprint.I've asked the VPE to give me some feedback on my performance, it hopes of killing it in December so I can maximize that sexy, sexy raise. I noted a few areas where I see my own weaknesses (the biggest one being stuck "spinning my wheels" on problems, and not knowing when to give up/ask for help) and asked for some suggestions in how to improve in those areas.Overall I'm hopeful that this will be a constructive 1:1, but I do have a few concerns, mostly centered around making sure I'm using this rare chance for detailed personal feedback in the best way possible.* I'm a total crybaby. I don't respond well to criticism, even when it's justified and I completely agree. Rationally, I value this feedback greatly, and love knowing exactly how to best improve myself. My gut emotional reaction can be overwhelming, though. I've shed a few tears in front of managers before and it's really demoralizing. How can I mitigate the risk of this happening, or at least do some pre-emptive damage control? Surely it's not appropriate to say "btw boss, probably gon cry, but it's all good, promise"? I already recognize that my productivity levels are lower than they were those first weeks, and I know this is going to come up.* How can I best work with my manager to come up with a good plan for improving performance for the next few weeks? What kind of goals are effective for these sorts of things? This is ultimately a management problem more than anything else - I'm not very good with people problems, hence the software engineering. :)Looking for any advice from people who have found these kinds of performance gauges useful. Thanks in advance!
3rn9f4	1446741449	362	Hey /r/careerguidance!I'm having a bit of difficulty trying to make a career change. I've been in healthcare for about a decade. I have a degree in Business, Communications and another degree in my healthcare specialty.I've been in my specialty for about 5 years and healthcare in general for about 5 years before that. Prior to that I've held jobs in B2C sales, and a few other entry level jobs.I hate healthcare. It's an awful field, it's beyond toxic and it's not what people think it is. It's not about helping people at all. I'm on the verge of a burnout, if I don't get terminated before that.Let me tell you a bit about my life. I'm 28, married, just recently bought a house. I provide this because I have a minimum salary I require. Moving is off the table (working remote is actually Ideal for me. My salary requirement isn't awful though, I'd be happy with anything north of 70k (which is the absolute bottom end of salaries required to live in my area, given CoL)I have a 2nd career as well. I work for a startup. It provides a small monthly salary and I can work remote but given the time and position, that has a few more years before it could be my sole income. I was a sales there but recently just got bumped up to manager (but no longer in sales). It's given me incredible opportunities to travel, tons of people to meet, and the field is growing like crazy. I can't wait for that to really take off.But for now, I need out of healthcare and into something else to hold me over. I can learn anything, but between my 2 jobs I'm pretty limited on time. I almost want to say I need someone to take a flier on me, but really I'd like to think I'm a pretty safe bet.What kind of fields should I be looking into, or what titles should i be looking at? I've played around a bit on angel.co but nothing has ever really come from that. I've had an interview or 2, but again, nothing.I'd love to hear what /r/careerguidance thinks.Thanks!

3qhnc1	1445989299	424	I came into highschool as a total nerd (not that that's a bad thing), and left as what one could call a 'burnout' for lack of a more modern term.My dad is an engineering professor at a local state university, a very good but not well known school, and I managed to get accepted despite my 2.53 GPA with my decent SAT score of 1740.I am going there tuition free because of my dad, but even living at home that amounts to five thousand dollars a year in "fees" and I feel like I am wasting my parents money. I have been putting off getting a student loan because I feel like I will drop out sooner or later.I have not yet declared a major but my current classes are based on a computer science major. I am very good with computers and phones and electronics of many types but I feel that programming just isn't for me. More so than that, I feel that school isn't for me.By the end of highschool I was failing all but two of my classes, mostly just going to my classes and hanging out. I've never had a bad relationship with a teacher since 5th grade, in highschool I just seemed to have an understanding with almost all of my teachers that I would do work that I found interesting, which was less than half most of the time, and not do any other work. And I would often have intelligent discussions with my teachers about politics, literature, science, Led Zeppelin, you name it, with my teachers while the other students were doing their schoolwork. Last year my physics teacher and I would do chemistry experiments at the lab tables for him to use in his chemistry class.Today my mom was home from work and asked me to paint the side of the house. I didn't want to do it But after I started I was just listening to music and thinking, and I was super happy doing a menial task because my mind was free to think about whatever I wanted.I am likely failing most of my current classes, I just feel like I have no direction. I don't think I want to have some minimum wage job for the rest of my life because it allows me to think, but I might.Obligatory: sorry for the wall of text, but I feel like I needed to get it out there. I expect to edit this a few times to add things I forgot I wanted to say.
3oxcae	1444953940	384	Hello everyone. I'm about to transfer to a 4 year school from community college. I'm stuck on a few different paths, and I was wondering about opinions or advice on what I should go for. Edit. I forgot to list my skills lol. I am conversational in Japanese and can read a newspaper. I understand Microsoft Excel and have an okay grasp on some of the things to do with it. I write very well.Right now, I want to be somewhat autonomous. I like having responsibility, but not too much. I love interacting with people and I'm good at reading situations. I don't mind doing paperwork/clerical stuff. I want a job that can give me a livable wage (50k or higher by mid career would be preferable) in the US and has room to move up (and the possibility to maybe go to a different country). But I'm not super concerned with pay. Helping people and enjoying my job and having time to myself is the priority. I also hope for a good work/life balance, though I don't mind it being hectic for the first few years. I'll be majoring in communications. Here's what I had in mind, and other suggestions would be greatly appreciated.* **Human Resources** - I've looked into this and it seems pretty good. Though it's difficult to get into and many people won't like you. Good pay and advancement, I can work in many different fields. Stability. * **Public Relations** - Another hard field to get into and heavily relies on internships. Can be on call I've read. Potential to move up, but I've heard it's difficult. Can be cutthroat. I'm not a super competitive person so I worry about this. Good pay. Get to meet all sorts of people. I'm not too sure about stability here. * **Social Work** -  I get to work with many different types of people. Potential to make okay money if I open a private practice. Need a masters. I get to make a difference ands help people. Very difficult in beginning. High chance of burnout. I'm not too sure on work life balance, especially as the career progresses.So these are what I'm interested in. If you guys have any advice or maybe other careers that would be helpful. Thank you ahead of time.
3m7ql3	1443111287	236	I'm currently working as right hand man to the CEO of a small startup that is approaching profitability, but also going through a major expansion phase.  I'm pretty much running the show at this point and wearing a lot of hats.  The pressure and long hours are really wearing me down and I've been considering moving on for a while now.  I recently discovered that the CEO wants me to fully take on the reigns and become the official COO/President of the company, but I feel like I have been working in this role for over a year unofficially with a relatively low salary and had no raise, bonus or earned equity (though this has been promised over and over).  I looked on the role as a learning opportunity and I feel I've learned a lot.  I know now how to build a successful business from the ground up, and I did it with no real risk to me (though no $ reward either).  I feel like I could negotiate better terms, but I'm not sure I want to put in another 2 years here.  Given my state of mind and the fact that I fear I'm nearing burnout point, should I just cut my losses and exit gracefully?  I don't want to fall in the trap of running after the next carrot being waved in front of me.
3fwneu	1438799866	1193	This is a bit of a personal brain-dump, so I apologize in advance for the length. This is a throwaway because I don't use reddit anymore, but figured it was worth making an account to ask.  I am cross-posting this from a unicyclist forum I'm on, but I thought this would be a good place to get some wider-scoped advice.I am 26 years old and I've always been a person with a ton of interests and passions. This is my problem. I have way too many interests, and I feel like it gets me spread way too thin. I'm about 80% through writing a novel, have composed a ton of music in my home studio, frequently do graphic design and video production, etc, and spend at least an hour a night riding my unicycles.Lately I've also been really getting into hands-on stuff; I've been learning to weld in my spare time, bought a project motorcycle to attempt to disassemble, etc. Whether it's writing, music, or working with my hands, creative stuff really fuels me - if I don't have it I go insane.*My background:*A little about me: I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in psychology four years ago. I ended up with a fairly high GPA (3.8), and it was full-tuition so I have no debt toward that degree whatsoever. I've also always been a computer geek on the side (been repairing and programming since fourth grade) and have a lot of certifications (CEH, ACE, CHFI, A+, Network+) in that field.I am also a NASM certified personal trainer, and do a little of that on the side. I've also combined my interests and tried designing some fitness apps with my girlfriend, but my growing dislike for computer work has made it somewhat frustrating.As far as my day job goes: After I graduated I volunteered for three months at a local private investigation firm, and after that I started getting paid a very decent wage for it. For a while I used to do the fun stuff - GPS trackers, hiding in a van with a camera, using covert video equipment, etc, but now I've been shoehorned into doing computer forensics. I've had a lot of great experiences for someone my age, including co-teaching a university course in cybercrime for two years. I've been with that company for four years.While that sounds great on paper, sitting in front of a computer all day has never been on my list of priorities. I really don't like the cyber-security industry, and I feel like I'm a bad person to have as a face for it when there is absolutely no passion there. I am very good on computers, but I have gotten to the point where I absolutely hate being a "computer guy." I have zero drive for the computer industry and feel like my current job has turned into a typical geek sitdown job that I hate, as well as the stress that comes with looking at the nasty stuff people tend to hide on their computers.*My goals:*I want to do something that makes me happy. Not a bad goal to have, I think. I don't need to be rich, I just want to enjoy my days and not live under a bridge.*Some options I have been considering:** Going back to school for another Bachelor's degree. I had originally considered pursuing my psychology degree higher (MS or PhD) but after a lot of soul searching it has occurred to me that I really don't enjoy sitting around and listening to people's personal problems. I do that enough in my current job and personal life, and it's just not something I think I'd enjoy as a career. Specifically, I've looked at mechanical engineering, and while I know I am capable of understanding and doing the math and physics (I took a lot of those classes for electives), I can say that I honestly don't enjoy doing math problems for the sake of doing math problems; this is one of the things that frustrated me about pursuing a computer science minor. Plus, while the pay might be better, from what I know engineers are rarely hands-on, and instead spend their time in front of a computer all day. I really don't like to sit. A downside to a second Bachelor's is that it will likely be the most expensive out of all the options.* Expanding my personal training career. I love exercise, and I plan on being a trainer on the side for a long time no matter what. I have a lofty and probably unrealistic dream of doing unicycling classes and pushing it as the next greatest fitness activity. However, I don't think this is something I can make a full career out of, but instead more of a passionate side project.* Going to the local community college for an Associate's (two years) in their automotive technology program. This is mainly out of personal interest more than something I think I could make a ton of money at. I love working on machines and especially the hands-on portion, and my technical expertise is relatively low at this point so I'd really love to learn what they have to teach. I think knowing diagnostics from all my computer work would be useful as well. However, I've heard that actually working as a technician in the auto industry is very underpaid and a few of the grizzled older types have nothing but bad things to say about the future of the industry. The cost of this program would be very low compared to another BS or MS.* Going to school for some kind of Master's degree outside of psychology. Many non-psych programs - especially hard sciences - will require classes I haven't taken for my current Bachelor's degree, so I'd probably have to go back to school for remedial classes. This would probably be less money than a second BS, but still more expensive than a community college.* Pursuing some kind of art/music/writing program. I love this stuff, but again I'm not sure if it's just going to leave me in the same place I am with a Bachelor's in psych - a degree that doesn't do anything.* Buying a lot of lottery tickets. So far this one isn't doing much.Anyway, those are just my ideas right now as I'm sitting here. I'm feeling frustrated because I don't like the direction my career is going, but I also don't want to feel like I'm moving backward. Either way, it's an improvement from sitting here spinning in a circle while going nowhere.I am open to any and all suggestions you can throw at me. I would just like some outside and unbiased opinions to really help me think my way through this issue.If you made it this far, I'm very impressed that you navigated through this chaotic mental labyrinth I've constructed. Thankfully, there was no minotaur.Thanks for reading.*tl;dr:*  BS in psychology, lots of computer certs, certified personal trainer.  Not interested in going higher in psych and now hates sitting at a desk all day.  Likes creative things of all kids, especially writing, music, and hands-on work.

39jkl9	1434083003	235	When I first started working at my current job three years ago , I absolutely loved it.  But in these months I've been experiencing serious burnt out.  I feel frustrated, irritated, like I just have no energy left.Most of it, I think it stems from resentment.  I always stayed late and made my job a priority.  Even before my own personal life. Then I noticed how everyone else receives all these perks that I do not. Everyone gets reserved parking and phone paid. Even the new girl got a bonus her first year and I didn't until the 3rd. Its not so much that I care for it but just knowing that doesn't help my job satisfaction.  I mean I don't want to just demand things either.This is my first corporate job out of college. Maybe that's just how things are everywhere? Maybe I'm the one who is not confident &amp; assertive enough. I'm pretty sure at some point many of you have dealt with this. I really try to motivate myself everyday and be positive. But sometimes its not easy. Because I've seen how disposable people have been treated in the past, I fear speaking up.  I feel like I'd be walking on eggs shells. Other than that I like what I do overall and my boss is pretty cool.  But its starting to feel stagnant.  
38mzfp	1433487660	295	How do I explain to my boss and the owner of the company that changes to my working hours are having a negative effect on my work and my life?The basic idea is that when I joined the company 7 months ago I was on a nice contract, 40 hour week, 25 days holiday + public holidays and hours weren’t being tracked, we were trusted to balance our hours out as long as the work was being done.Since then things have changed a bit, I’m now on a 42 hour contract, 20 days holiday and a new Flexitime system that tracks our hours. After one month on the new system I’m on -7 hours in the system, it’s not that I’m not putting in the hours I need, the company was closed for one day and we also had to finish early one day for an open day.I work in Software Development but this contract is designed for the Admin and Factory workers, an area where a couple of extra hours are productive. With the intense nature of the way I work, they’re just adding to the burnout and having an impact on the quality of my work.I’ve put a lot of efficiency improvements in place since I started but now I’m realising that they don’t really help me. I get twice as much work done and the quality is vastly improved but the cost is that I’m completely worn out by the time I’m home.I’m trying to step back a bit and reduce my intensity but at the same time, I still have to spend just as many hours at work.I don't mind working long hours but to do so I need to know that I can relax a bit when things aren't so busy.
374k0o	1432499625	482	I am posting because I notice I go through periods (about 3 years) of being interested and working in an area and then will quickly grow tired of it. I feel like finding and maintaining focus / interest is hard for me. I've ignored the passion-based career advice and chose a discipline in college (mechanical engineering) that held my interest enough to complete a degree program. Previously in college I had been pre-med/biochemistry, then biochemistry, chemistry, chemical engineering, Chem E/biology before entering the Mech E program my junior year. I somehow graduated within the allotted 4 years but since then have gone on to work in IT. I worked in a helpdesk for 4 years during university, did side jobs thereafter and started working professional in IT consulting (generalist / helpdesk roles) about 2.5 years ago. Now I feel like apart from taking a new interest in things like devops, infrastructure and virtualization I'm once again asking myself what else is out there. I feel like I tend to exhaust jobs at ~ the one year mark if I don't find them challenging and feel an unsettling sense of divergence when it comes to my personal and professional interests; I can never stick with anything too long and I always want to pursue things that is one step beyond what I'm currently doing. Obviously in a corporate structure jumping up and down when it comes to projects is a no-go as is changing roles every year. I am wondering if my issue is just some kind of STEM / IT burnout or if I am legitimately facing a problem with focus. I don't suffer when it comes to the quality of my work - reveiws / client feed back have been fine. But I know I don't give a shit about what I do - it is just something convenient that pays me to keep up a life that is OK. I don't know if there is something wrong with me or if I'm asking for too much from the workplace or need to cultivate other hobbies. I feel like I am always diverging and my resume is worrying with the 1-2 year stints in different environments I have had in the past. I really need to stay put at my current job / role to build up a track record in one place, but at times I find the idea of staying for TWO WHOLE YEARS incredibly depressing; like I truly feel it will take me to the edge of my patience waiting around to complete what other people consider to be the BARE MINIMUM for a socially/professionally acceptable job stay. Idk how normal people do it or how I will manage. The worst part is the job isn't even a bad one. I just feel like I'm counting down all the time. Why am I so different from most professionals? 
2sffe8	1421261977	148	Hey everyone,I have been working as a teacher for the past 3 years in Colorado and am looking for a change. I have decided that teaching is not what I want to do for the rest of my life (burnout, financial security, philosophical differences mainly.) So come end of the school year I need to find something else to pursue.I graduated with a BS in Earth Science with a secondary teaching emphasis. I would love to do anything involving geosciences, but I also have a strong foundation in chemistry and physics. I am pretty tech oriented and would like to do something along those lines. What jobs am I even qualified for? Where would I begin to look? I am willing to move pretty much anywhere in the country (US.) Money, flexibility and travel (for work or pleasure) are my primary motivators at this point. Any advice is welcome!
2ofdht	1417834158	164	Being a recent college grad I need the work experience on my resume, and can't afford the work gap, but I quit after about a month and a half. It was a bad place to work. The CEO would give neck rubs to some of the female employees, he once walked around with a golf club on his shoulder, all the management did was micro-manage without being helpful. Everyone was afraid of getting fired for the slightest infraction.The job was just doing data entry, so not really a career position, and once I had already been hired on was told by other employees that none of the data enterers ever get promoted, and most quit from burnout somewhere after a year.So how do I explain this to potential employers in an interview? Should I write something down about it on my resume? Should I just list it as temp-to-hire and say that I chose not to work there and say that they cannot contact them?
2a6g8o	1404853668	343	tl;dr: Not making enough at an ad agency and don't particularly love the environment anyway. Should I freelance? Change careers? I just graduated with a degree in entrepreneurial studies / branding, marketing, and public relations and landed a job at a nationally known ad agency as a graphic designer.I make $40,000 a year (something like 23 net) and work 40-80 hours per week. I've worked nights, stayed late, and just generally kicked ass on projects for a year a year now and universally everyone is really pumped about me as a member of the team. I get a ton of creative control which frequently puts me into the roles of art director, creative director, strategist, and UX. I work on brands that are globally known and get to affect them really directly.Unfortunately—and this is probably a bit of burnout talking—I really don't like any part of job. The hours, intense pressure, and extremely low pay don't seem to make this worth it. I have friends who bartend that make more than me on paper and put in 20 hours a week. I still like the creative world—particularly innovation, trend forecasting, and art direction. And, I have a really wide skill set, but I'm finding myself disgruntled by the thought of working as much as I do for the next ten years for only incremental increases in salary. With student loans approaching there is absolutely no way I could afford the most basic life on my salary today. I have web development experience and it seems like freelance is the best way to go to earn a sizable income.Should I switch careers? Try to work at Google? I've been considering ANYTHING that gives me more financial freedom and my life back. From photo styling assistant (day rate $350, I have some experience here) to executive assistant to even a bartender / server. I've stumbled across a lot of friends who (1) didn't go to college (2) enjoy their job more than I. (3) Make 2-3x what I do. Is anyone else feeling any of this?
